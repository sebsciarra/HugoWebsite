      <description>Note. Generated using a variety of artificial intelligence tools for image processing and image generation (specifically, fotor, DALL-E2, and Deep Dream Generator) I&amp;rsquo;m Sebastian Sciarra and I am currently a PhD candidate in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology program at the University of Guelph. I am largely interested in statistics, coding, and machine learning, and have used my time as a graduate student learning a variety of topics in these areas while completing my dissertation.</description>

      <description>This is a list of useful resources I have stumbled upon while completing my dissertation and learning about machine learning, statistics, and programming.
Courses and Lecture Series&#39; CS 47980 - Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems Bloomberg - Foundations of Machine Learning Computer Science 25300 / 35300 &amp;amp; Statistics 27700 - Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning CS 156 - Learning Systems CS 485/685 - Machine Learning Theory: this is a more advanced course that I personally would only encourage taking after taking at least two of the above courses.</description>
