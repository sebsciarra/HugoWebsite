title: "The Game of Supervised Machine Learning: Understanding the Setup, Players, and Rules" 
draft: false
summary: "Supervised machine learning can be conceptualized as a game where the goal is to maximize predictive power. In this paper, I use the excess risk decomposition framework to provide a setup for the game of supervised machine learning. I then decompose mean squared error loss into bias (squared), variance, and noise and introduce these components as 'players' of the game. The bias-variance tradeoff is then used to explain the behaviours of bias (squared), variance, and noise and to synthesize two rules for the game of machine learning. The paper ends with a discussion of boundary conditions on these rules of supervised machine learning. Given the considerable amount of Python code in this post, I created the smltheory package to help readers navigate the code and facilitate their learning of concepts."

Five points require mentioning before beginning this whitepaper. First, I created a Python package that contains all the functions provided in this whitepaper that are needed to demonstrate propositions of supervised machine learning theories. The package is called `smltheory` and can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the code in the Bash code block below (see line <a href="#1">1</a>). 

```{bash, engine = 'bash',  echo=T, eval=F, results = 'hide', hlopts=list( language = 'bash')}
pip install smltheory
```

Second, although I provide the source code for Python functions in this whitepaper where appropriate, the functions can be easily used by installing the `smltheory` package and prefixing each function with `smltheory` (or with the desired shorthand; I use `sml` to represent `smltheory`) so that the function is used from the loaded package.

Third, I used Python and R code throughout this whitepaper and often imported objects created in Python into R for creating plots. To use Python and R coinjointly, I used the `reticulate` package made for R and created a conda environment to use Python (see lines <a href="#2">2--13</a> below). Note that I installed the necessary packages in the conda environment.

```{r python-r-setup, eval=F, echo=T} 
library(reticulate)

#create and use conda environment
conda_create(envname = 'blog_posts',  python_version = '3.10.11')
use_condaenv(condaenv = 'blog_posts')

#install packages in conda environment
py_packages <- c('numpy', 'pandas', 'scikit-learn', "plotnine", "statsmodels", "smltheory")
conda_install(envname = 'blog_posts', packages = py_packages, pip=T)

#useful for checking what packages are loaded
py_list_packages(envname = 'blog_posts', type = 'conda')
```


Fourth, for any reader interested in using the source code for each function, it will be necessary to load `trun_mvnt` Python module from GitHub (see lines <a href="#14">14--15</a> below). 

```{bash, engine = 'bash',  echo=T, eval=T, results = 'hide', hlopts=list( language = 'bash')}
git clone https://github.com/ralphma1203/trun_mvnt.git
```
```{python trun-mvnt, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
from trun_mvnt import trun_mvnt as tvm
```

Fifth, the packages and modules in the Python code block below must be loaded (see lines  <a href="#15">15--24</a> below). 

```{python modules, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
from functools import partial
import plotnine as pt 
import concurrent.futures
import smltheory as sml
```

Make sure that version 0.1.10 of `smltheory` is loaded (see lines <a href="#25">25--26</a> below). 

```{python smltheory-version, echo=T, eval=T, results = 'hold', class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
sml.version('smltheory')
```


```{bash, engine = 'bash',  echo=F, eval=T, hlopts=list( language = 'bash')}
rm -r trun_mvnt
```

# Introduction{#intro}

In supervised machine learning, a game is played with the goal of maximizing the ability to predict. Whether the focus is to predict churn rates (among employees and/or customers), regions with high potential for growth, or something as innocuous as fruit fly behaviour, supervised machine learning can be used to solve these problems. Although a nearly infinite number of models can be deployed to predict a given outcome, it is important that data scientists not rely on trial and error to find effective models and, instead, make purposeful decisions. To do so, it important that data scientists understand the game in supervised machine learning.

To understand the game of supervised machine learning, I will use the excess risk decomposition framework to situate the commonly known entities of bias, variance, and noise. Because excess risk decomposition is seldom presented in tandem with bias, variance, and noise, I hope to provide a deeeper understanding of both topics by presenting them together. 

This paper will contain six parts.  First, I will provide a necessary background by presenting a formal model of learning. Second, I will present the excess risk decomposition framework as setup for understanding the game of supervised machine learning. Third, I will introduce the 'players' (i.e., bias, variance, and noise) of supervised machine learning by decomposing mean squared error. Fourth, I will explain the behaviours of bias, variance, and noise by presenting the bias-variance tradeoff. Fifth, I will explain the rules of supervised machine learning and how to succeed, Sixth, and last, I will provide an overview of situations where the rules of supervised machine learning cannot be applied. 

# A Formal Model of Learning 

To provide the context of supervised machine learning, I begin with a formal model of learning and present it in three parts. First, I will present the learning context. Second, I will present the learning model. Third, and last, I will present the selection of models. 

## Learning Context

In this section, I will present the learning context. Consider an example where a tourist arrives in a new country and wants to learn how to identify a good wine without opening the bottle. Given her experience with wine, she decides to use two features: 1) the weather that occurred for the particular year the wine was produced and 2) the winemaking quality. Both features are ranked on a 1--10 scale (where 1 indicates poor weather/winemaking quality and 10 indicates excellent weather/winemaking quality). To determine the effectiveness of this approach, she decides to taste the wines of several vineyards and, for each wine, rate the quality of the weather during the year, the winemaking quality, and then taste each wine and provide a rating (1--10 scale). After collecting the data, the tourist plans to take a subset of the data to train her models. In more formal terms, there are two components that would be considered as learning inputs: 

1) *Feature space* ($\mathbf{X}$): the set of features used for prediction. In the current example, the features of weather ($\mathbf{x}_1$) and winemaking quality ($\mathbf{x}_2$) for each wine are stored in a matrix, $\mathbf{X} = \[\mathbf{x}_1^\top, \mathbf{x}_2^\top\]$, with each row of $\mathbf{X}$ being an observation such that $\mathbf{x}_n = \[\mathbf{x}\_{1n}, \mathbf{x}\_{2n}\]$.
2) *Outcome space* ($\mathbf{Y}$): the set of variables being predicted. Because there is only one outcome variable of the wine quality ratings, the outcome space is simply a vector, $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y}$.

Together, the feature and outcome spaces comprise the data collected by the tourist such that, for each $n$ wine, there is a feature vector/outcome pair, $\mathbf{x}_n, y_n$.

Importantly, the tourist does not and never assumes *realizability*: That the features of weather and winemaking quality completely predict wine quality ratings. Instead, she assumes that, for a given pair of weather and winemaking quality values, there is a distribution of plausible wine ratings, which introduces stochasticity (randomness). Dropping the realizability assumption in the current example is certainly intuitive: Wine quality is affected by many factors outside of weather and winemaking quality such as soil quality, altitude, and age of the vines. Importantly, even if the tourist were to collect data for all the variables that affect wine quality, realizability (i.e., a one-to-one mapping between the predictors and and the outcome) would not occur because of the aforementioned stochasticity (randomness) and measurement error.[^1]

[^1]: Although measurement error is unlikely with directly observable variables (or manifest variables) such as altitude, measurement error is likely be incurred when measuring a variable such as winemaking quality because it is not directly observable; it is a latent variable that must be approximated using indicators (e.g., cleanliness of winemaking procedure, treatment of grapes, winemaker's motives, etc.). 

To reflect the uncertainty that follows from dropping realizability (also known as *agnostic learning*), the tourist assumes a joint distribution over the feature and outcome spaces. In contrast to the realizability setting where there is a one-to-one mapping function between the feature and outcome spaces, $f: \mathbf{X} \rightarrow \mathbf{Y}$, a probabilistic relation between the feature and outcome spaces is specified. Specifically, I assume a joint distribution over the feature and outcome spaces, $\mathcal{D}(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$, such that a distribution of possible outcomes exists for any given set of feature values, $\mathcal{D}((\mathbf{x}, y)|\mathbf{x})$. By conceptualizing the feature-outcome space as probabilistic, the tourist can account for measurement error and stochasticity. 


## Learning Model 

With a setup for the learning context, I will present a learning model. Revisiting the wine assessment example, the tourist has now returned from the vineyards and recorded information on each $n$ wine regarding the weather, winemaking quality, and quality of the wine. The tourist then takes a large subset of the data for training models and uses weather and winemaking quality to predict wine quality. To evaluate her models, she decides to use the mean squared error loss such that 

$$
\begin{align} 
MSE &= \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}\big(f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i\big)^2}{n} = \frac{\sum^n\_{i=1} \ell \ \big(f(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i\big)^2}{n}
\label{eq:mean-sq-error}
\end{align} 
$$

where $n$ is the number of observations in the data set and $i$ is an individual observation. Under ideal circumstances, the tourist would know the joint distribution underlying the feature and outcome spaces, $D(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the *generalization/true error* or *risk* of a function: The error on unseen data. Obtaining the generalization error is important because it indicates how well a model will perform when deployed. If the tourist knows the joint distribution, then the generalization error can be computed as the expected squared loss such that 

$$
\begin{align} 
L_{\mathcal{D}}(f) = \mathbb{E}\[\ell \ \big(f(\mathbf{x}), y\big)^2\],
\end{align} 
$$

where $L_D(f)$ is the loss of $f$ with respect to the joint distribution, $\mathcal{D}$. Unfortunately, because the joint distribution is seldom known in practice, generalization error cannot be directly computed. 

Although generalization error is not directly computable, one solution is to compute loss on a collected data sample. By using a sample of collected data, the strong law of large numbers indicates that, as the number of observations approaches infinity, the loss obtained on the sample data will approach the generalization error (see Equation \ref{eq:gen-error-approx}):

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^n (f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i)^2}{n} &= L\_{\mathcal{D}}(f). 
\label{eq:gen-error-approx}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, to obtain an approximation of the generalization error, loss can be computed on a sample, which is often called the *empirical loss* and is represented as 

$$
\begin{align} 
L_S(f) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\big(f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i\big)^2}{n}.
\label{eq:training-loss}
\end{align} 
$$

It should be noted that a minimum sample size is required for the empirical loss to estimate the generalization error within some margin of error. This minimum sample size depends on several factors such as the complexity of the class of functions being used (or hypothesis class), the probability of obtaining a bad sample that leads to a generalization error above a certain amount, and the probability of obtaining a bad sample (for detailed explanations, see [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5NlRg8SjZg&list=PLPW2keNyw-usgvmR7FTQ3ZRjfLs5jT4BO) on the theory of machine learning).  

## Model Selection

Because the empirical loss provides an approximation of the generalization error, one strategy for finding the function with the lowest generalization error, $f^\ast$, is to find the function with the lowest empirical loss. This approach of finding the function with the lowest empirical loss is often called *empirical risk minimization*. Mathematically, empirical risk minimization can be represented as 

$$
\begin{align}
f^\ast &= \underset{f}{\arg\min} \ Ls(f), 
\label{eq:erm}
\end{align}
$$

where $f^\ast$ is function in the set of all possible functions, $f$, that obtains the lowest empirical loss. 

Two points deserve mention with respect to $f^\ast$. First, it is often called the *empirical risk minimizer* because it obtains the lowest empirical loss. Second, in the current example, because empirical risk minimization occurs over the set of all possible functions, $f$, then the best possible function will inevitably exist in this set. The best possible function (i.e., the function with the lowest generalization error) is often called the *Bayes decision function*. Because we assume agnostic learning (i.e., that no function can perfectly predict the outcome), the Bayes decision function will have nonzero loss, which is often called the *Bayes risk*.


# Excess Risk Decomposition: A Setup for Understanding Supervised Machine Learning

In the sections that follow, I will provide a general framework or setup for understanding how three types of error inevitably emerge in the formal model of supervised learning presented above. This framework is often called excess risk decomposition  because the errors occur in addition to the Bayes risk {{< cite "bottou2007" >}}. For a lecture on excess risk decomposition, see [Bloomberg - Lecture 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1472&v=YA_CE9jat4I&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg.github.io%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title). Excess risk can be represented mathematically as shown below in Equation \ref{eq:excess-risk}:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Excess risk } = \epsilon_{app} + \epsilon_{est} + \epsilon_{opt}, 
\label{eq:excess-risk}
\end{align}
$$

where $\epsilon_{app}$ represents approximation error, $\epsilon_{est}$ represents estimation error, and  $\epsilon_{opt}$ represents optimization error. 

In the sections that follow, I will explain each type of error and provide Python code to simulate it. Importantly, before explaining each type of error, a data set is first required. Therefore, I first will first provide an overview of the data generation procedure for the wine assessment example. 

## Preamble: Data Generation Procedure{#data-generation}

In the wine assessment example, there were two features and one outcome. For the two features, the tourist collected data on weather and winemaking quality and computed composite scores for each feature, thus yielding a continuous distribution of scores on a 1--10 scale. For the outcome, the tourist tasted each wine and similarly calculated composite scores for wine quality that likewise yielded a continuous distribution of scores on a 1--10 scale (1 indicates a poor wine and 10 indicates an excellent wine). To simulate these data, I will assume agnostic learning and, therefore, use a joint distribution over the feature and outcome spaces, with the features of weather ($\mathbf{x}_1$) and winemaking quality ($\mathbf{x}_2$) being normally distributed such that

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{X} &= \[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2\] \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma) \cdot \mathbb{I}(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2 \in \[1, 10\]), \\\\
\boldsymbol{\mu} &= \[5, 7\] \text{ and} \\\\
\boldsymbol{\sigma} &= \[1.2, 1.4\] \\\\
\end{align*}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

with the covariance matrix

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align*}
\rho_{\mathbf{x}\_1, \mathbf{x}\_2} &= .35  \text{ and} \\\\  
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} &= \begin{bmatrix} 
\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_1  & \rho_{\mathbf{x}\_1, \mathbf{x}\_2} \boldsymbol{\sigma}\_1\boldsymbol{\sigma}\_2 \\\\
\rho_{\mathbf{x}\_1, \mathbf{x}\_2} \boldsymbol{\sigma}\_1\boldsymbol{\sigma}\_2 &\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_2
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
\end{spreadlines}
$$


Note that a truncated normal distribution was used to generate data for the features such that all the values for each feature fell between 1 and 10 (inclusive). To generate the outcome values for wine quality, I used the regression equation shown below in Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate}:

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{Xw} + \mathbf{e}, \text { where}
\label{eq:outcome-generate} \\\\
\mathbf{X} &= \[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{x}_1^2, \mathbf{x}_2^2, \mathbf{x}_1\mathbf{x}_2\], \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{w} &= \[0.3 ,  0.1 ,  0.07, -0.1 ,  0.1\], \text{ and} 
\label{eq:pop-weights} \\\\
\mathbf{e} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1.5). \nonumber 
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Because Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate} produced outcome values that were not scaled within a 1--10 range, I used the min-max normalization formula shown below in Equation \ref{eq:rescale} to scale the outcome values of wine quality within a 1--10 range such that 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y}_{scaled} = a + \frac{(\mathbf{y} - \min(\mathbf{y}))(b-a)}{\max(\mathbf{y})-\min(\mathbf{y})}
\label{eq:rescale},
\end{align}
$$

where $a$ indicates the new lower limit (i.e., 1), $b$ indicates the new upper limit (i.e., 10), $\min(y)$ indicates the old lower limit, and $\max(y)$ indicates the old upper limit. To compute the old lower limit, I used the lowest possible value for $\mathbf{x}_1$ and the highest possible value for $\mathbf{x}_2$ of 10,[^2] which, in turn, set the values for the polynomial features ($\mathbf{x}^2_1, \mathbf{x}^2_2$) and and interaction feature ($\mathbf{x}_1\mathbf{x}_2$). I then pre-multiplied this vector by the vector of population weights (see Equation \ref{eq:pop-weights}) and subtracted an error value that corresponded to three standard deviations below the mean, yielding the following computation for the old lower limit in Equation \ref{eq:old-lower-limit}:

[^2]: Although counterintuitive, the highest value for $\mathbf{x}_2$ was used because of the negative-value weight applied on the square of the second feature, $\mathbf{x}^2_2$ of -0.1. 

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\text{Old lower limit } &= \mathbf{w}^\top \[1, 10, 1, 100, 10] - 3(1.5) 
\label{eq:old-lower-limit} \\\\
&=-12.13. \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

To compute the old upper limit, I used the highest possible values for $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ of 10, which, in turn, set the values for the polynomial features ($\mathbf{x}^2_1, \mathbf{x}^2_2$) and interaction feature ($\mathbf{x}_1\mathbf{x}_2$). I then pre-multiplied this vector by the vector of population weights (see Equation \ref{eq:pop-weights}) and added an error value that corresponded to three standard deviations above the mean, yielding the following computation for the old upper limit in Equation \ref{eq:old-upper-limit}:

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\text{Old upper limit } &= \mathbf{w}^\top \[10, 10, 10, 100, 100] + 3(1.5) 
\label{eq:old-upper-limit} \\\\
&=15.50. \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

With the outcome variable of wine quality being scaled, the population regression coefficients can also be scaled by first computing a scaling factor (Equation \ref{eq:scaling}) and then multiplying the old regression weights by the scaling factor (Equation \ref{eq:scaled-weights}).

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\text{Scaling factor} &= \frac{\text{New scale range}}{\text{Old scale range}} 
\label{eq:scaling} \\\\
&= \frac{10 - 1}{15.50 - (-12.13)}  \nonumber \\\\
&=  0.33 \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{w}_{scaled} &= \mathbf{w}(0.33)  
\label{eq:scaled-weights} \\\\
&= [0.10, 0.03, 0.02, -0.03,  0.03] \label{eq:scaled-values}
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Lastly, the new scaled intercept value can be computed by first computing the mean of each feature in $\bar{\mathbf{X}}$, taking the weighted sum of the rescaled weights and mean of each feature, $ \mathbf{w}_{scaled}^\top\bar{\mathbf{X}}$, and then subtracting this value from the mean outcome value, $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$ (see Equation \ref{eq:scaled-intercept}). 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{intercept}_{ scaled} &= \bar{\mathbf{y}} - \mathbf{w}^\top\_{scaled} \bar{\mathbf{X}}
\label{eq:scaled-intercept}
\end{align}
$$

The Python code block below (lines <a href="#27">27--133</a>) defines the functions that generate the data for the wine example such that there are two features (`weather`, `winemaking_quality`) and one outcome variable (`wine_quality`). The outcome variable is created using Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate} and then scaled using Equation \ref{eq:rescale}.

```

The Python code block below (lines <a href="#134">134--150</a>) generates the multivariate normal normal such that all values for the features and outcome variables are truncated between values of 1 and 10. Importantly, because we are generating the data, we can adopt an omniscient approach in the winemaking example and generate one data for computing empirical loss and another data set for computing generalization error. Note that the sample size used for the generalization error is substantially larger so that generalization error can be accurately estimated.

```{python data-generation, echo=T, eval=F,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
#set the population means and SDs for weather and winemaking quality
mu = [5, 7]
sd = [1.2, 1.7]

#population correlation
rho_weather_winemaking =  0.35 
cov_matrix = sml.create_covariance_matrix(sd = sd, rho =  rho_weather_winemaking)
sample_size_emp_loss = 250
sample_size_gen_error = 1e4

#data used to compute empirical loss; note seed = 27 by default
data_emp_loss = sml.generate_mult_trunc_normal(cov_matrix = cov_matrix, mu = mu, 
                sample_size = sample_size_emp_loss, seed = 27)
                                          
#data used to compute generalization error 
data_gen_error = sml.generate_mult_trunc_normal(cov_matrix = cov_matrix, mu = mu, 
                 sample_size = sample_size_gen_error, seed = 21)
```

Because of the long processing time needed to generate the above data sets, I provide the data sets in the `smltheory` package and show how they can be obtained in the Python code block below (see lines <a href="#151">151--155</a> below).

```{python data_emp_gen_error, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
#data for empirical loss
data_emp_loss = sml.get_data_emp_loss()

#data for generalization error
data_gen_error= sml.get_data_gen_error()
```

## Approximation Error: The Result of Having to Constrain Empirical Loss Minimization 

To obtain an approximation of a function's ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data (i.e., generalization error), the strong law of large numbers indicated that, with sufficient sample size, the performance on sample data would be sufficient. As a corollary, empirical risk minimization then suggested that the best possible function could be identified by determining the function that obtained the lowest empirical loss. Unfortunately, empirical risk minimization inevitably fails when optimizing over over all possible functions. One method to prevent empirical risk minimization from failing is to constrain optimization to a set of functions. Although constraining empirical risk minimization provides a solution, it creates approximation error. 

In the sections that follow, I will explain three points. First, I will explain how empirical risk minimization fails. Second, I will explain how constraining empirical risk minimization can prevent overfitting. Third, I will explain how approximation error is an inevitable outcome of constraining empirical risk minimization. 


### Overfitting: The Failure of Empirical Risk Minimization 

To recall, empirical risk minimization assumes that the function with the lowest generalization error can be identified by simply determining the function with the lowest empirical loss. Mathematically, 

$$
\begin{align}
f^* &=\underset{f}{\arg\min} \ Ls(f).
\tag{\ref{eq:erm} $\$ revisited}
\end{align}
$$

Although optimizing empirical loss over all possible functions makes theoretical sense, it is impractical for two reasons. First, doing so is computationally demanding. Second, and perhaps most important, optimizing generalization error over all possible functions will likely result in *overfitting*: When the generalization error of a function is considerably higher than its empirical loss because the function's high complexity has caused it to (over)fit sample-specific information.  

Overfitting commonly occurs as an outcome of minimizing empirical loss over a set of functions that is too complex or large. As an example of overfitting, I compute empirical loss and generalization error over the set of polynomial models up to the ninth order ($P = 9$) such that 

$$
\begin{align}
f \in \mathcal{O}:f(\mathbf{x}_i) &= \text{int} + \bigg(\sum\_{p=1}^{P} w\_{p_1} x^p\_{1_i} + w\_{p_2} x^p\_{2_i}\bigg) + \mathbb{I}\_{(P\ge 2)}\bigg(\sum\_{p=1}^{P-1}\sum\_{q=1}^{P-1} w\_{pq} x^p\_{1_i} x^q\_{2_i}\bigg),
\label{eq:all-functions}
\end{align}
$$

where $f(\mathbf{x}\_i)$ represents the predicted wine quality value for the $i^{th}$ wine, which is the sum of an intercept ($\text{int}$), the weighted sum of the corresponding $i^{th}$ weather ($x_{1_i}$) and winemaking quality ($x_{2_i}$), and the weighted sum of all possible two-way interactions. Note that, in Equation \ref{eq:all-functions}, interactions are only computed if the specified polynomial order is greater than or equal to 2, $\mathbb{I}\_({P \ge 2)}$. The Python code block below (lines <a href="#151">156--217</a>) contains functions that compute the generalization error and empirical loss (using mean squared error; see Equation \ref{eq:mean-sq-error}) for each polynomial model with an order in the specified range. 

```{python overfitting-functions, eval=F, echo=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
def gen_poly_reg_eq(poly_order, include_interactions=False):
    
    # compute polynomial terms for predictors
    weather_pred = ' + '.join(['np.power(weather, {})'.format(ord_value) for ord_value in range(1, poly_order + 1)])
    winemaking_quality_pred = ' + '.join(['np.power(winemaking_quality, {})'.format(ord_value)
                                          for ord_value in range(1, poly_order + 1)])

    # Compute all two-way interactions between weather and winemaking_quality
    if include_interactions and poly_order > 1:

        interaction_terms = ' + '.join(
            ['np.multiply(np.power(weather, {}), np.power(winemaking_quality, {}))'.format(p1, p2)
             for p1 in range(1, poly_order)
             for p2 in range(1, poly_order)])

        predictors = ' + '.join([weather_pred, winemaking_quality_pred, interaction_terms])

    else:
        predictors = ' + '.join([weather_pred, winemaking_quality_pred])

    return equation

    y_test = model.predict(data_gen_error)

    emp_loss = mean_squared_error(y_true=data_emp_loss['wine_quality'], y_pred=model.fittedvalues)
    gen_error = mean_squared_error(y_true=data_gen_error['wine_quality'], y_pred=y_test)

    emp_loss_gen_error_dict = {'emp_loss': emp_loss, 'gen_error': gen_error}

    return emp_loss_gen_error_dict


def compute_all_emp_gen_errors(data_emp_loss, data_gen_error, poly_order_range, include_interactions=False):

    # create all polynomial equations within the desired range
    gen_poly_reg_eq_partial = partial(gen_poly_reg_eq, include_interactions=include_interactions)

    poly_equations = list(map(gen_poly_reg_eq_partial, poly_order_range))

    # create partial version of function with data_emp_loss and data_gen_error fixed
    emp_gen_error_partial = partial(compute_emp_gen_error, data_emp_loss=data_emp_loss,
                                    data_gen_error=data_gen_error)

    # for each polynomial equation, compute empirical loss and generalization error
    all_emp_gen_errors = list(map(emp_gen_error_partial, poly_equations))

    # convert dictionary to dataframe and then compute polynomial orders by using row indexes
    df_emp_gen_errors = pd.DataFrame(all_emp_gen_errors)
    poly_orders = pd.Series([poly_order for poly_order in poly_order_range], name="poly_order")

    # concatenate poly_orders and dataframe to create complete dataframe
    df_emp_gen_errors = pd.concat([poly_orders, df_emp_gen_errors], axis=1)

    return df_emp_gen_errors
```

If empirical risk minimization is followed, then the function with the highest polynomial order would be chosen as the function with the lowest generalization error. Figure \ref{fig:emp-loss} shows that empirical loss decreases almost linearly as polynomial order increases. The Python code block below (lines <a href="#218">218--241</a>) computes and plots empirical loss for each polynomial model up to the ninth order.

If generalization error is examined, however, then the conclusion of empirical risk minimization to use the highest-order polynomial model results in a highly undesirable outcome. Figure \ref{fig:overfit-plot} shows that, while empirical loss decreases as a model's polynomial order increases, generalization error suddenly increases exponentially after the sixth polynomial order. Specifically, while empirical loss remains below 1 across all polynomial orders, generalization error goes from a value of approximately 2.41 at the sixth polynomial order to a value of approximately 1389.20 at the ninth polynomial order. Thus, although the most complex polynomial model results in the lowest empirical loss, it results in the highest generalization error, and so would perform the least well if used to make predictions on new data. The Python code block below (lines <a href="#242">242--270</a>) computes and plots the empirical loss and generalization error for each polynomial model up to the ninth order.

Given that the previous example showed how overfitting occurred with just a subset of complex functions, it becomes apparent that overfitting is inevitable if all functions are considered. Overfitting presents a serious issue to practitioners because it can lead to the use of models that make highly inaccurate predictions and cause organizations to incur severe costs. Fortunately, the occurence overfitting can be reduced by modifying the method of empirical risk minimization.


### Reducing the Chance of Overfitting: Constrained Empirical Risk Minimization{#constrained-erm}

Although overfitting is inevitable when all possible functions are considered, it is conceivable that a function with low generalization error can still be found if only a subset of functions are considered. By restricting the set of functions over which to optimize empirical loss, it may be possible to largely prevent overfitting. This approach of restricting the set of functions over which to optimize empirical loss is known as  *constrained empirical risk minimization* and can be represented mathematically as

$$
\begin{align}
f_\mathcal{F} =  \underset{\mathcal{f \in F}}{\arg \min} \ L_s(f), 
\end{align}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ represents the constrained set of functions.

Returning to the wine example, the tourist may have knowledge that leads her to constrain the set of functions over which to optimize empirical loss. Specifically, she will only consider polynomial functions up to the fifth order and omit the two-way interaction terms because of how they introduce complexity in an exponential way with respect polynomial order; that is, they grow exponentially in number as a function of polynomial order. Thus, the restricted set of functions over which the tourist will optimize empirical loss is 


$$
\begin{align}
f \in \mathcal{F}:f(\mathbf{x}_i) &= \text{int} + \bigg(\sum\_{p=1}^{P} w\_{p_1} x^p\_{1_i} + w\_{p_2} x^p\_{2_i}\bigg),
\label{eq:constrained-functions}
\end{align}
$$

where $P = 5$. Figure \ref{fig:constrained-erm} below shows the empirical loss and generalization error as a function of polynomial order with constrained empirical risk minimization (see Python clode block below [lines <a href="#266">271--305</a> ] for corresponding code). Across all polynomial orders, empirical loss provides a close approximation of generalization error. Thus, the tourist has prevented the occurrence of overfitting by implementing constrained risk minimization. As an aside, a proof of the learning success of constrained empirical risk minimization can be found in [Section 2.3.1](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf#page=94) of {{< cite "shalev-shwartz2014" >}}.

In using constrained empirical risk minimization, the tourist can select the empirical risk minimizer and accurately predict wine quality for unseen data. With constrained empirical risk minimization optimization, an upper limit is placed on the complexity of functions, and, to the extent that complexity is limited, the incidence of overfitting will be reduced. As an aside, other methods such as regularized regression (for a review, see) and bagging (see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205)) can be used to combat overfitting. Although constrained empirical risk minimization appears is a solution, it is by no means a perfect solution, as will be discussed in the next section.


#### Model Selection in Practice: Train, Validate, and Test{#model-practice}

Before proceeding to discuss the limitations of constrained empirical risk minimization, a discussion regarding model selection in practice is apropos. Up to this point, I used two data sets to compute empirical loss and generalization error, with the data set for generalization error being considerably large in order to obtain an accurate estimate. Given that I generated the data with Python functions, I could easily use two different data sets for computing empirical loss and generalization error. Unfortunately, the privilege of generating data with functions does exist in practice: Data must be collected and are, therefore, finite. 

Although data are finite in practice, practitioners still want to accomplish three goals of developing models, comparing them, and then estimating how well the best model performs on unseen data (i.e., generalization error). Models that perform the best on unseen data are chosen for deployment. Importantly, practitioners must prevent overfitting in accomplishing each goal. To do so, they split the data into the following three parts:

1) *Training set*: data used to develop models and obtain parameter estimates. 
2) *Validation set*: data used to obtain estimate of each model's generalization error so that models can be compared. Because validation data is new (with respect to the training data), overfitting is unlikely, and so the model that obtains the lowest validation error is assumed to be the best model. 
3) *Test set*: data serves as a last check that the best model identified using the validation set is indeed the best model. Because many models are often compared using the validation set, it is conceivable that one model may outperform all the other ones by overfitting patterns/noise specific to the validation set. To ensure this is not the case, empirical loss is computed on the test set. 

Three points deserve mention with respect to model selection in practice. First, more refined approaches exist for model selection such as cross validation (see [Section 7.10](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf#page=260) in {{< citePara "hastie2009" >}}) and [bagging](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205). Second, the way in which data are trained, validated, and tested should resemble how the model will be used after deployment. For example, if a model will be used to make predictions one month into the future, it should be trained, validated, and tested such that data points within one month of when predictions will be made are not included. Third, deciding the sample size of each set is an important decision, and a good discussion on this issue can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13610074/is-there-a-rule-of-thumb-for-how-to-divide-a-dataset-into-training-and-validatio). 

### The Irreducible Error That Results From Constrained Empirical Risk Minimization: Approximation Error

Although constrained empirical risk minimization reduces the incidence of overfitting, it is not without its limitations. By constraining the set of functions over which to optimize empirical loss, it is unlikely that the best possible function (i.e., Bayes decision function) will exist in the constrained set. Figure \ref{fig:approx-error} depicts the set of all functions and the constrained set of functions, $\mathcal{F}$. Although the Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, exists in the set of all functions, it does not exist in the constrained set of functions. Thus, even the the best function in the constrained set of functions, $f_\mathcal{F}$---which I call the *constrained empirical risk minimizer*---will have a generalization error greater than that of the Bayes decision function, with the difference between the two functions constituting *approximation error* (see Equation \ref{eq:approx-error} below).

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Approximation error }\hspace{0.25cm} (\epsilon_{app}) \hspace{0.25cm} &=  L_D(f_{\mathcal{F}}) - L_D(f^\ast) 
\label{eq:approx-error}
\end{align}
$$
Moreover, in looking at Figure \ref{fig:approx-error}, it is also apparent that approximation error increases to the extent that empirical risk minimization is constrained. As empirical minimization is constrained (i.e., the size of the circle in Figure \ref{fig:approx-error} decreases), the generalization error of the constrained empirical risk minimizer ,$L_D(f_{\mathcal{F}}$, will increase, causing approximation error to increase. Recall that, because a probabilistic relation is assumed between features and the outcome---and not a a one-to-one relation as is the case with realizability---the Bayes decision function will have a generalization error greater than zero, which is often called the Bayes risk. The Bayes risk can be represented as the difference between the obtained value for the outcome, $y$, and the output of the Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, which is shown below in Figure \ref{fig:approx-error}.

To compute approximation error, I calculate the difference between the generalization errors of the Bayes decision function and the constrained empirical risk minimizer. Beginning with the Bayes decision function, the scaled population regression weights from Equation \ref{eq:scaled-values} can be used to compute predictions. The difference between the predictions and actual wine quality values are used to compute the Bayes risk (or generalization error of the Bayes decision function). The Python code block below (lines <a href="#306">306--339</a>) constructs a function for computing the Bayes risk. 


```{python bayes-decision, eval=F, echo=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
def generate_bayes_features(data):
  
    # Feature columns
    predictors = data[["weather", "winemaking_quality"]]
    bayes_features = pd.concat(objs=[predictors, predictors**2, predictors.prod(axis=1)], axis=1)

    return bayes_features


def compute_bayes_intercept(data):

    bayes_features = generate_bayes_features(data=data)

    # Intercept
    intercept = np.mean(data["wine_quality"]) - np.sum(provide_weights() * compute_rescaling_factor() *
                                                       np.mean(bayes_features, axis=0))

    return intercept


def compute_bayes_risk(data):

    bayes_features = generate_bayes_features(data=data)

    # Compute intercept
    intercept = compute_bayes_intercept(data=data)

    # Compute predictions for wine quality
    test_pred = intercept + np.dot(a=bayes_features, b=provide_weights() * compute_rescaling_factor())

    # Compute mean squared error
    bayes_risk = mean_squared_error(y_true=data['wine_quality'], y_pred=test_pred)

    return bayes_risk
```

Ending with the constrained empirical risk minimizer, Figure \ref{fig:constrained-erm} indicated that the second-order polynomial model resulted in the lowest generalization error. To get the best possible parameter estimates for the second-order polynomial model (with no interactions), I generated another large data set (`data_best_in_class`; see Python code block containing lines <a href="#340">340--345</a>). As with previous data sets, `data_best_in_class` can be obtained from the `smltheory` package. 

```{python data-best-in-class, echo=T, eval=F,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
sample_size_best_in_class = 1e4

#use large data set to obtain a close approximation of the best possible estimates for the second-order 
#polynomial model (without interactions)
data_best_in_class = sml.generate_mult_trunc_normal(cov_matrix = cov_matrix, mu = mu, 
                     sample_size = sample_size_best_in_class, seed=7)
```

The Python code block below (lines <a href="#334">346--361</a>) computes the approximation error by calculating the difference between the Bayes risk and the generalization error of the constrained empirical risk minimizer.

```{python approximation-error, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
data_best_in_class = sml.get_data_best_in_class()

#Bayes risk 
bayes_risk = sml.compute_bayes_risk(data = data_gen_error)

#compute empirical loss and generalization error for polynomial models up to fifth order
constrained_erm = sml.compute_all_emp_gen_errors(data_emp_loss = data_best_in_class,
                                             data_gen_error = data_gen_error,
                                             include_interactions = False,  
                                             poly_order_range=range(2, 3))
                                             
#compute approximation error
approx_error = constrained_erm["gen_error"][0] - bayes_risk

print('Approximation error:', np.round(a = approx_error, decimals = 5))
```

To show approximation error, I plot the Bayes decision function and the constrained empirical risk minimizer below in Figure \ref{fig:app-error}. The left hand plot represents a magnified version of the right hand plot between the y-axis values of .230 and .234. The difference in generalization error between the Bayes decision function ($f^\ast$, light blue line) and the constrained empirical risk minimizer ($\hat{f}\_\mathcal{F}$, medium blue line) constitutes approximation error (see Equation \ref{eq:approx-error}). Importantly, both functions do not vary as a function of sample size, which is shown by the x-axis. Because both the constrained empirical risk minimizer and the Bayes decision function represent ideal functions, they are not affected by the sample size used for model development, and so are constant lines in Figure \ref{fig:app-error} (I plot the sample size used for model development on the x-axis, as I build on Figure \ref{fig:app-error} throughout this paper). The R code block below (lines <a href="#361">362--419</a>) contains the code for creating Figure \ref{fig:app-error}.

## Estimation Error: The Result of Having Limited Amount of Data

In constraining empirical risk minimization, the empirical risk minimizer is only guaranteed to be found to the extent that sample size is large. Given that large sample sizes cannot always be obtained in practice, then the empirical risk minimizer, $f_\mathcal{F}$, is unlikely to be obtained. Instead, some imperfect estimation of $f_\mathcal{F}$, will result which I will call the *sample risk minimizer* and denote as $\hat{f}\_s$. Figure \ref{fig:est-error-concept} below shows that, as a result of having a limited sample size, the sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}\_s$, results in a generalization error that is greater than that of the constrained empirical risk minimizer, $f_\mathcal{F}$. The extent to which the generalization error of the sample risk minimizer is greater than that of the constrained empirical risk minimizer is often called *estimation error*, and is represented below in Equation \ref{eq:est-error}:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Estimation error}\hspace{0.25cm} (\epsilon_{est})  \hspace{0.25cm} &=  L_D(\hat{f}_n) - L_D(f\_{\mathcal{F}}) \\label{eq:est-error}
\end{align}
$$

Unfortunately, $f_\mathcal{F}$, can only be obtained to the extent that a very large data exists. Because practitioners often have limited data, only an estimated version of $f_\mathcal{F}$ will be obtained, $\hat{f}_s$, which I call the sample risk minimizer.

To construct Figure \ref{fig:est-error} above, I followed three steps. First, I used a large data set (`data_best_in_class`) to identify the constrained empirical risk minimizer, $f\_\mathcal{F}$, from the (constrained) set of functions defined in Equation \ref{eq:constrained-functions} (see Python code block above [lines <a href="#340">340--359</a>]). Briefly, only polynomial functions up to the fifth order of weather and winemaking quality were allowed to predict wine quality in the constrained set of functions. Second, to obtain each sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}_s$, I sampled data (without replacement) from the same large data set used to obtain the constrained empirical risk minimizer (i.e., `data_best_in_class`) and then extracted the lowest generalization error value from the function in the constrained set (see Equation \ref{eq:constrained-functions} and Python code block below [lines <a href="#419">420--444</a>]).[^3] Third, I computed the Bayes risk, $L_D(f^\ast)$. Importantly, to obtain an accurate estimation of each function's generalization error, I computed mean squared error on another large data set (`data_gen_error`). The R code block below (lines <a href="#445">446--511</a>) contains the code for creating Figure \ref{fig:est-error}. 
 
[^3]: The astute reader might notice that I eschewed the method of empirical risk minimization in selecting the sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}_s$. That is, instead of picking the polynomial function that resulted in the lowest empirical loss, I picked the polynomial function with the lowest generalization error. Two reasons exist for why I used the the function with the lowest generalization error as the sample risk minimizer. First, because I used an independent data set for computing generalization error that was much larger than the data set for computing empirical loss (i.e., `data_gen_error`), using it to identify the function with the lowest generalization error provided a stronger demonstration that the generalization error of the sample risk minimizer is always greater than or equal to the constrained empirical risk minimizer, $f\_{\mathcal{F}}$. Second, using the function with the lowest generalization error aligns more closely with how models are selected in practice (see section on [Model Selection in Practice](#model-practice)). 

```{python estimation-error,  echo=T, eval=F,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
def compute_sample_risk_gen_error(sample_size, data_best_in_class, data_gen_error,
                                  poly_order_range=range(1, 6)):
   
    # Use random_state to ensure reproducibility and prevent resampling from adding noise to estimates
    gen_errors = compute_all_emp_gen_errors(data_emp_loss=data_best_in_class.sample(n=sample_size, random_state=27),

                                            poly_order_range=poly_order_range)['gen_error']

    # Return generalization error of sample risk minimizer
    return gen_errors.min()
  
# Fix the arguments except for sample_size and then use map to vectorize over sample size values
compute_sample_risk_gen_error_partial = functools.partial(sml.compute_sample_risk_gen_error,
                                                          data_best_in_class = data_best_in_class,
                                                          data_gen_error = data_gen_error,
                                                          poly_order_range = range(1, 5))

# Call the partial function with est_sample_sizes
est_sample_sizes = range(5, 1000)
est_gen_errors = list(map(compute_sample_risk_gen_error_partial, est_sample_sizes))

                             "sample_risk_gen_error": est_gen_errors})
```

Because of the long computing time needed to compute the generalization error of each sample risk minimizer, I provide the data set that contains these generalization errors in the `smltheory` package, which can be obtained using the `get_data_est_error()` function (see line <a href="#445">445</a> below).

## Optimization Error: The Result of Imperfect Optimization

To understand optimization error, I will first provide brief overviews of two topics. First, I will describe the typical way of obtaining regression weights (i.e., using closed-form solutions). Second, I will provide an overview of gradient descent and how, given enough iterations, it can be used to arrive at the weights obtained with the closed-form solution. After explaining these two topics, I will show how optimization error can be introduced by using an insufficient number of iterations in the gradient descent algorithm.  

### A Brief Review of Using Closed-Form Solutions to Obtain Regression Weights

Returning to the wine example, the tourist wanted to use weather and winemaking quality to predict wine quality. Together, weather ($\mathbf{x}_1$) and winemaking quality ($\mathbf{x}_2$) constituted the set of features, $\mathbf{X} = \[\mathbf{x}_1^\top, \mathbf{x}_2^\top\]$, with wine quality representing the outcome vector, $\mathbf{y}$. Thus, using $\mathbf{X}$, the tourist wanted to compute predicted values for wine quality such that 

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{Xw}.
\end{align}
$$

To determine the accuracy of predictions for wine quality, the tourist used the mean squared error such that 

$$
\begin{align}
\ell_{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \lVert \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{Xw} \rVert^2_2.
\label{eq:mse-matrix}
\end{align}
$$

Note that Equation \ref{eq:mse-matrix} is simply a matrix version of the scalar mean squared error function presented in Equation \ref{eq:mean-sq-error}. To obtain accurate predictions for wine quality, the tourist decides to find some set of weights that minimizes the mean squared error. Mathematically, 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{w}_{MSE} &= \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\arg\min} \ \frac{1}{n} \lVert \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{Xw} \rVert^2_2 \nonumber \\\\ 
&=  \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\arg\min}  \ \frac{1}{n} (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{Xw})^\top (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{Xw}) \nonumber \\\\ 
&=  \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\arg\min}  \ \frac{1}{n} (\mathbf{y}^\top\mathbf{y} - 2\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}\mathbf{w}).
\end{align}
$$

To find $\mathbf{w}_{MSE}$, it can be solved by computing the gradient of the mean squared error with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ and setting it to zero (see below).[^4] Note that I provide Equation \ref{eq:grad-resid} because it shows how the gradient is positively related to the size of the residual (i.e., $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{Xw}$). 

[^4]: Note that, for the formula of $\mathbf{w}\_{MSE}$ in Equation \ref{eq:weight-mse-min} to be computable, the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ must be linearly independent. Linear independence guarantees that $(\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X})^{-1}$ exists and that $\mathbf{w}\_{MSE}$ is the best solution. For a more detailed explanation see, [Lecture 5 - Gradient Descent and Least Squares](https://uchicago.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bbd55a27-0fa6-4855-85f2-adbf01393f3a). Note that, although the lecture uses the sum of squares as the loss function, the conclusions obtained in this paper are identical to those obtained with mean squared error. 

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\nabla_w \ell_{MSE} &= \frac{\partial\ MSE}{\partial \ \mathbf{w}} = \frac{1}{n} \frac{\partial}{\partial \ \mathbf{w}} \bigg(\mathbf{y}^\top\mathbf{y} - 2\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}\mathbf{w}\bigg) \nonumber \\\\ 
&=\frac{1}{n}\bigg(0 - 2\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{y} + 2\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}\mathbf{w}\bigg) \nonumber \\\\ 
 &= \frac{1}{n} \bigg(2\mathbf{X}^\top(\underbrace{\mathbf{Xw} - \mathbf{y}}\_{\text{Residual}})\bigg)
 \label{eq:grad-resid} \\\\
\text{Set } \ \nabla_w \ell_{MSE}  &= 0 \nonumber \\\\ 
0 &= - 2\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{y} + 2\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{w}_{MSE} &= (\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{y}
\label{eq:weight-mse-min}
\end{align} 
\end{spreadlines}
$$

To show that $\mathbf{w}\_{MSE}$ does indeed contain the set of weights that minimizes the mean squared error, I will first compute $\mathbf{w}\_{MSE}$ using Equation \ref{eq:weight-mse-min} and then show that it indeed minimizes the mean squared error. Beginning with the computation of $\mathbf{w}_{MSE}$, I compute it using the wine data set I generated in the section on [Data Generation](#data-generation) (see the Python code block between lines <a href="#512">512--525</a>, which I repeat below). 

```{python data-gen-repeat, echo=T, eval=F,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
#set the population means and SDs for weather and winemaking quality
mu = [5, 7]
sd = [1.2, 1.7]

#population correlation
rho_weather_winemaking =  0.35 
cov_matrix = create_covariance_matrix(sd = sd, rho =  rho_weather_winemaking)
sample_size_emp_loss = 250

#data used to compute empirical loss; note seed = 27 by default
data_emp_loss = generate_mult_trunc_normal(cov_matrix = cov_matrix, mu = mu, sample_size = sample_size_emp_loss)

#note that the data_emp_loss data set can be loaded from the smltheory package
data_emp_loss = sml.get_data_emp_loss()
```  

The Python code block below (see lines <a href="#526">526--557</a>) computes $\mathbf{w}_{MSE}$ and finds that 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{w}_{MSE} &= \[0.64, 1.1,  -0.01 ,-0.1 \]
\label{eq:mse-min}
\end{align}
$$

```{python  w-mse-solution, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
def extract_feature_outcome_data(data, sample_size=10, sample_data=False, poly_order=2):
    
    if sample_data:
        data = data.sample(n=sample_size, random_state=27)

    # extract set of features and then expand according to polynomial order that is specified
    original_features = data[["weather", "winemaking_quality"]]
    features = pd.concat(objs=[original_features ** order for order in range(1, poly_order + 1)], axis=1).to_numpy()

    outcome = data[["wine_quality"]].to_numpy().ravel()

    dict_features_outcome = {"features": features, "outcome": outcome}

    return dict_features_outcome


def compute_weight_min_mse(data, poly_order=2):
    
    # gather necessary components for matrix-matrix multiplications
    dict_data = extract_feature_outcome_data(data=data, poly_order=poly_order)
    features = dict_data["features"]
    outcome = dict_data["outcome"]

    # compute weight values that result from using closed-form solution
    w_mse = np.linalg.inv(np.transpose(features).dot(features)).dot(np.transpose(features)).dot(outcome)

    return w_mse.ravel()
  
w_mse = sml.compute_weight_min_mse(data = data_emp_loss)

print("Best weights:", np.round(a = w_mse, decimals = 2))
```


Ending with the visualization of $\mathbf{w}_{MSE}$, I now show that it indeed results in the lowest mean squared error value. To construct a more palatable visualization of the mean squared error (i.e., using two dimensions), I only allow the first weight to vary ($w_1$) and fix the values of the remaining three weights. Thus, the x-axis shows the values for the first weight and the y-axis represents the mean squared error value. I construct this plot using the Python code block below (see lines <a href="#558">558--618</a>) and show it in Figure \ref{fig:mse-plot}. When the first regression weight value ($w_1$) is 0.64, the lowest mean squared error value is obtained, and this matches with the result in Equation \ref{eq:mse-min} of using the closed-form solution in Equation \ref{eq:weight-mse-min}.

 
```{python  w-mse-figure, echo=T, eval=F,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}

    outcome = dict_data["outcome"]

    # compute weights that result from using closed-form solution
    w_mse = compute_weight_min_mse(data=data, poly_order=poly_order)

    # extract all the values of the closed-form solution except the first value

    w_initial = np.insert(arr=w_initial, obj=0, values=w_guess)

    yy = np.transpose(outcome).dot(outcome)
    wXy = np.transpose(w_initial).dot(np.transpose(features)).dot(outcome)
    wXXw = np.transpose(w_initial).dot(np.transpose(features)).dot(features).dot(w_initial)

    mse = yy - 2 * wXy + wXXw

    return mse

### A Brief Review of Gradient Descent 

In looking at Figure \ref{fig:mse-plot}, the best set of regression weights ($\mathbf{w}_{MSE}$) occur at the trough of the mean squared error function. In the previous section, the weight value at the trough was solved for analytically by setting the gradient to zero and solving for $\mathbf{w}$ (see Equation \ref{eq:weight-mse-min}). In this section, I will arrive at the trough not through an analytical method, but by descending the mean squared error function in Figure \ref{fig:mse-plot} until the trough is reached. This method of descending a function until a trough is reached is known as *gradient descent*. I represent the gradient descent algorithm in the pseudocode code below in Algorithm 1.

<pre id="grad_descent" class="pseudocode"  data-line-number=true >
    \begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Gradient Descent}
    \begin{algorithmic}
    \REQUIRE{Function for computing loss function, $\ell_{MSE}$ (see Equation $\ref{eq:mse-matrix}$)}
    \INPUT{Initial guess for weights $\mathbf{w}^{(0)}$} 
    \PROCEDURE{gradientDescent}{$K, \epsilon, \tau$}
      \STATE{$k = 0$}
     \WHILE{$k < K$ \AND $\lVert \mathbf{w}^{(k)} - \mathbf{w}^{(k+1)} \rVert^2_2 < \epsilon$} 
      \STATE{$\mathbf{w}^{(k+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(k)} - \tau \nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\ell_{MSE}(\mathbf{w}^{(k)})$.} 
      \STATE{$k \mathrel{+}= 1$}
      \STATE{$k \mathrel{+}= 1$}
     \ENDWHILE
    \ENDPROCEDURE
    \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}
</pre>


In the gradient descent algorithm, weights are updated by travelling in the negative gradient direction until either the squared norm (i.e., square of sum of squared differences) is less than than some error value ($\epsilon$) or $K$ iterations are reached. Importantly, the step size ($\tau$) controls how much the algorithm moves in the negative gradient direction. Although outside the scope of the current discussion, the step size value must not be too small or too large; if too small, too much time will be needed to reach the trough and, if too large, the trough may never be reached because the algorithm will jump around too much. 

The Python code block below (lines <a href="#619">619--681</a>) contains functions necessary for computing gradient descent. 

```{python  gradient-descent-functions, echo=T, eval=F,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
def compute_gradient(features, outcome, weights, num_samples):
    
    # Compute predictions (Xw using current weights
    predictions = np.dot(features, weights)

    # Compute the error (difference between predictions and target, Xw - y)
    residuals = outcome - predictions

    # Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to weights (2X(Xw - ))
    gradient = -2 * np.dot(features.T, residuals) / num_samples

    return gradient


def gradient_descent(data, initial_weights, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000, poly_order=2,
                     epsilon=1e-20, expedite_algorithm=False, return_log=False):
   
    dict_data = extract_feature_outcome_data(data=data, poly_order=poly_order)
    features = dict_data["features"]
    outcome = dict_data["outcome"]

    # Initialize weights and variable that stores all weights on each iteration
    all_weights = initial_weights  # variable necessary for logging weight values after each iteration
    weights = np.array(initial_weights)
    num_samples = len(features)

    iteration = 0
    diff = float('inf')  # Set an initial large value to ensure the loop runs at least once

    # loop proceeds until either maximum number of iterations is reaches or the difference
    # becomes less than the desired error"""
    while iteration < num_iterations and diff > epsilon:

        gradient = compute_gradient(features=features, outcome=outcome,
                                    weights=weights, num_samples=num_samples)

        # Update weights using the gradient and learning rate
        weights -= learning_rate * gradient

        # if desired, I expedite the algorithm by setting all the weights except the first one to the
        # values obtained by the closed-form solution in each iteration
        if expedite_algorithm:
            weights[1:] = compute_weight_min_mse(data=data, poly_order=poly_order)[1:]

        # update iteration number and check if difference in weights is less than epsilon
        iteration += 1
        diff = np.sum(np.square(learning_rate * gradient))

        if return_log:
            all_weights = np.vstack(tup=(all_weights, weights))

    if return_log:
        # create dataframe
        col_names = ["{}{}".format('w', str(weight_num)) for weight_num in range(1, all_weights.shape[1] + 1)]
        df_all_weights = pd.DataFrame(data=np.array(all_weights),
                                      columns=col_names)
        # insert iteration number
        df_all_weights.insert(0, "iteration_num", df_all_weights.index)

        return df_all_weights

    else:
        return weights
```


In Figure \ref{fig:gradient-plot}, I plot the same mean squared error function as in Figure \ref{fig:mse-plot}, but show how the gradient descent algorithm arrives at the best regression weights. After each iteration, the mean squared error value decreases because the algorithm descends the function by travelling in the negative gradient direction (see the mean squared error values obtained after the 100$^{th}$ and 300$^{th}$ iterations). After iteration 1100, the algorithm arrives at the best regression weights, $\mathbf{w}_{MSE}$. Therefore, the gradient descent algorithm provides a viable alternative for obtaining regressoin weights obtained using closed-form solutions.

### Creating Optimization Error by Limiting the Number of Gradient Descent Iterations

Given that the gradient descent requires many iterations to arrive at the best possible parameter estimates, the number of iterations can be limited to create optimization error. By limiting the number of gradient descent iterations, the set of obtained estimates will be less optimal than the set of estimates obtained with the closed-form solution and, therefore, have greater generalization error. The increase in generalization error that results from using a suboptimal optimization algorithm is *optimization error*, and is represented below in Equation \ref{eq:opt-error}:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Optimization error } \hspace{0.25cm} (\epsilon_{opt}) = L_D(\tilde{f}_n) - L_D(\hat{f}_n), 
\label{eq:opt-error}
\end{align}
$$

where $L_D(\tilde{f}_s)$ represents generalization error of the model where parameter estimates were obtained with a suboptimal optimization algorithm and $L_D(\hat{f}_s)$ represents generalization error of the sample risk minimizer. Importantly, I will call $L_D(\tilde{f}_s)$ the *optimization risk minimizer*. 

Figure \ref{fig:opt-error-diagram} provides a visual for conceptualizing optimization error. If no closed-form solution exists for computing parameter estimates, then some optimization algorithm must be used. If optimization is imperfect, it will obtain estimates that are less optimal than those obtained with the closed-form solution. These suboptimal estimates introduce additional generalization error called optimization error (see Equation \ref{eq:opt-error}). Importantly, optimization error can be negative or positive because optimization algorithm can converge on a set of estimates that are subtoptimal on the data set, but more optimal than $\hat{f}_s$ on new data.

  <span><em>Note. </em>The Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, exists in the set of all functions, but it does not exist in the constrained set of functions, $\mathcal{F}$. Thus, the best function in the constrained set of functions, $f_\mathcal{F}$, will have a generalization error greater than that of the Bayes decision function, with the difference between the two functions constituting approximation error (see Equation \ref{eq:approx-error} below). Unfortunately, $f_\mathcal{F}$, can only be obtained to the extent that a very large data exists. Because practitioners often have limited data, only an estimated version of $f_\mathcal{F}$ will be obtained, $\hat{f}_s$, which I call the sample risk minimizer. Because the sample risk is an imperfect estimate of $f_\mathcal{F}$, it will necessarily have greater generalization error that is called estimation error. If no closed-form solution exists for obtaining parameter estimates, then some optimization algorithm must be used to estimate the sample risk minimizer. I call the function that results from optimization the optimization risk minimizer, $\tilde{f}_s$. To the extent that optimization is imperfect, $\tilde{f}_s$ will have a different generalization error than $\hat{f}_s$, with the difference between them constituting optimization error. Importantly, optimization error can be negative or positive because optimization algorithm can converge on a set of estimates that are subtoptimal on the data set, but more optimal than $\hat{f}_s$ on new data.</span>

To compute optimization error, $\epsilon_{opt}$, I followed two steps. First, in accordance with model development practices (see [Model Development in Practice](#model-development)), I determined the polynomial function with the best generalization error. Second, to obtain parameter estimates that were suboptimal relative to the closed-form estimates obtained for the sample risk minimizer ($\hat{f}_s$), I used the limited number of iterations in the gradient descent algorithm. Specifically, gradient descent was limited by setting the maximum number of iterations to 100 ($k = 100$), the learning rate to 0.005 ($\tau = 0.005$), and the error value is $1e-20$ (see Algorithm 2 below).

Because of the long processing time needed to compute the generalization error of each optimization risk minimizer, I provide the data set that contains these generalization errors in the `smltheory` package, which can be obtained using the `get_data_opt_error_fast()` function (see lines <a href="#790">790</a> below).

```{python  optimization-error-data, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}

```

Figure \ref{fig:opt-error} below shows the generalization error of optimization risk minimizers as a function of sample size. he left hand plot represents a zoomed version of the right hand plot between the y-axis values of 0.23 and 0.29. As sample size increases, the generalization error of optimization risk minimizer, $L_D(\tilde{f}_s)$, tends to decrease. The difference between $L\_D(\tilde{f}_s)$ (dark blue line) and the generalization error of the sample risk minimizer ($L_D(\hat{f}\_s)$, blue line) is shown by the brace and represents optimization error (see Equation \ref{eq:opt-error}). For reference, I also show the constrained empirical risk minimizer ($f\_\mathcal{F}$, medium blue line) and the Bayes decision function ($f^\ast$, light blue).

## Summary of Excess Risk Decomposition 

Excess risk decomposition provides a general framework for understanding the 'game' of machine learning. In this framework, three types of error exist. First, approximation error represents the difference in generalization error between the best possible function (Bayes decision function) and the best function in a constrained set of functions (constrained empirical risk minimizer). Thus, approximation error results from constraining empirical risk minimization, and increases to the extent that the constraint increases (see Figure \ref{fig:app-error}).

Second, estimation error represents the difference in generalization error between the constrained empirical risk minimizer and the best function obtained on a sample (sample risk minimizer). With data often being limited in practice, estimation error increases as sample size decreases (see Figure \ref{fig:est-error}). 

Third, optimization error represents the difference in generalization error between the sample risk minimizer and the best function obtained with an optimization algorithm (i.e., the optimization risk minimizer). To the extent that optimization is subtoptimal, optimization error will be nonzero. Although optimization error tends to be some positive nonzero value (see Figure \ref{fig:app-error}), it is possible for optimization error to be negative. 

# The 'Players' of Supervised Machine Learning: Bias, Variance, and Noise

In supervised machine learning, bias, variance, and noise can be conceptualized as the players of the game because they can be derived from the mean squared error loss function. In this section, I will show how mean squared error can be decomposed into bias, variance, and noise. I will then use the setup provided by excess risk decomposition to provide a deeper understanding of bias, variance, and noise. For a great lecture on this topic, see [Lecture 19 - Bias Variance Decomposition](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/lecturenote12.html). 

## Decomposing Mean Squared Error Into Bias, Variance, and Noise 

Before decomposing mean squares error, it is important to become familiar with the following two components:

1) *Expected classifier*: the average function (i.e., average of each parameter estimate) obtained with an infinite sampling of data of sample size $n$ from the joint distribution, $s \sim \mathcal{D}^n$. In the winemaking example, the expected classifier could be obtained if the tourist repeatedly sampled wines (making sure to record the weather, winemaking quality, and wine quality), model each data set with the same model, and then compute average values for each parameter. Mathematically, the average function can be obtained by computing the integral of $f_s$ over all possible $s$ samples (see Equation \ref{eq:exp-class}) such that

\\[
\begin{align}
\bar{f} &= \mathbb{E}_{s\sim \mathcal{D}^n}\[f_s\] = \underset{s}{\int} f_s P(s) \partial s.
\label{eq:exp-class}
\end{align}
\\]

2) *Expected label*: the average value, $\bar{y}$, for a given $\mathbf{x}$. In the winemaking example, the expected label represents the average wine quality value for a given pair of weather and winemaking quality values. Because computing the expected label requires knowledge of the underlying distribution, it can only be obtained with the Bayes decision function, and so can be represented mathematically in several ways as shown below in Equation \ref{eq:exp-label}:

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{y} &= f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{y|\mathbf{x}} \[y\] = \underset{y}{\int} y P(y) \partial y
\label{eq:exp-label}
\end{align}
$$

Now I will decompose mean squared error into bias, variance, and noise. In decomposing mean squared error, we are interested in the how well a function performs on average for a given feature-outcome pair with unlimited sampling. That is, we want to compute the expected generalization error such that, if we were to sample some data set $s$ of sample size $n$ from the joint distribution $\mathcal{D}$, how well would the resulting model perform on some new feature-outcome pair $(\mathbf{x}, y)$ drawn from $\mathcal{D}$. Mathematically, we want to know 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \ \Big[(f_s(\mathbf{x}) - y)^2\Big] &= \underset{s\mathbf{x}y}{\iiint}\Big(f_s(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)^2 P(\mathbf{x}, y)P(x) \ \partial \mathbf{x} \partial y \partial s.  \label{eq:exp-gen-error}
\end{align}
$$

To decompose the expected generalization error shown in Equation \ref{eq:exp-gen-error} above, I will simply add and subtract the expected classifier of $\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})$ and simplify the resulting equation  

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \ \Big[(f_s(\mathbf{x}) - y)^2\Big] &= \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ \hspace{-0.3cm} s \sim \mathcal{D}^n}  \  \bigg[\Big(\underbrace{f_s(\mathbf{x}) - \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})}\_{a} + \underbrace{\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - y)}\_{b}\Big)^2\bigg] \nonumber \\\\ 
&=  \mathbb{E}\_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\  \hspace{-0.6cm}{s \sim \mathcal{D}^n}} \bigg[\Big(f_s(\mathbf{x})-\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\Big)^2\bigg] + \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)^2 \bigg] + 2 \ \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ \hspace{-0.3cm} s \sim \mathcal{D}^n}\Bigg[\bigg(\Big(f_s(\mathbf{x}) − \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\Big)\Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})−y) \bigg)   \Bigg] 
\label{eq:exp-gen-exp}
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

A closer inspection of the last term in Equation \ref{eq:exp-gen-exp} below shows that it is zero.

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align*}
 2\ \mathbb{E\}_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n}\Bigg[\bigg(\Big(f_s(\mathbf{x}) − \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\Big)\Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})−y) \bigg) \Bigg] &= 2\ \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y)}\Bigg[ \mathbb{E}\_{ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \bigg[\Big(\big(f_s(\mathbf{x}) − \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\big)\big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - y\big) \Big) \bigg] \Bigg]  \\\\ 
 &= 2\ \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}}\Bigg[ \bigg(\Big(\underbrace{\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\Big)}\_{=0}\Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)\bigg)\Bigg] \\\\
 &= 0 
\end{align*}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Thus, Equation \ref{eq:exp-gen-exp} becomes 

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \ \Big[(f_s(\mathbf{x}) - y)^2\Big] &= \underbrace{\mathbb{E}\_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \bigg[\Big(f_s(\mathbf{x})-\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\Big)^2\bigg]}\_{\text{variance}} + \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)^2 \bigg],
\label{eq:var-decomp}
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

with the first term representing *variance*: The squared difference between the prediction of a given model trained on single data set, $f_s(\mathbf{x})$, and the expected classifier, $\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})$. Now I will decompose the second term in Equation \ref{eq:var-decomp} above into bias (squared) and noise by adding and subtracting the expected classifier, $f^\ast(\mathbf{x})$. 

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)^2 \bigg] &= \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \Bigg[\bigg( \underbrace{\Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big)}\_{a} + \underbrace{\Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)}\_{b}\bigg)^2\Bigg] \nonumber \\\\
&= \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D}}  \Bigg[ \underbrace{\Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big)^2}\_{\text{Bias}^2} \Bigg] + \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y)  \sim \mathcal{D}} \Bigg[ \underbrace{\Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)^2}\_{\text{Noise}}\Bigg] + 2 \ \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \Bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big) \Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big) \Bigg]
\label{eq:bias-noise}
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Importantly, Equation \ref{eq:bias-noise} contains bias (squared) and noise. Using the math in Equation \ref{eq:bias-noise}, the following definitions can be deduced for bias and noise: 

1. *Bias*: the difference between the prediction of the average function and the Bayes decision function (i.e., best possible function), $\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})$. 
2. *Noise*: the squared difference between the Bayes decision function and the actual outcome value,  $f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y$.

With respect to the last term in Equation \ref{eq:bias-noise}, it is zero, which can be shown by expanding over the expectation, as shown below.

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align*}
 2 \ \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \Bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big) \Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big) \Bigg] &= 2\ \mathbb{E}\_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D}} \Bigg[ \mathbb{E}\_{y|\mathbf{x} } \bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big) \Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big) \bigg]\Bigg]  \\\\ 
&= 2\ \mathbb{E}\_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D}} \bigg[ \Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big) \underbrace{\Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big)}\_{=0}\bigg] \\\\

Therefore, the initial expression of the expected mean error squared error presented in Equation \ref{eq:exp-gen-error} decomposes into the sum of variance, bias (squared), and noise, as shown below in Equation \ref{eq:exp-decomp}:

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \ \Big[(f_s(\mathbf{x}) - y)^2\Big] &= \underbrace{\mathbb{E}\_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D} \\\\ s \sim \mathcal{D}^n} \bigg[\Big(f_s(\mathbf{x})-\bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\Big)^2\bigg]}\_{\text{Variance}} + \mathbb{E}\_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D}}  \Bigg[ \underbrace{\Big(\bar{f}(\mathbf{x}) - f^\ast(\mathbf{x})\Big)^2}\_{\text{Bias}^2} \Bigg] + \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y)  \sim \mathcal{D}} \Bigg[ \underbrace{\Big(f^\ast(\mathbf{x}) - y\Big)^2}\_{\text{Noise}}\Bigg]. 
\label{eq:exp-decomp}

## Situating Bias, Variance, and Noise in the Excess Risk Decomposition Setup

With the mean squared error function decomposing into the sum of bias(squared), variance, and noise (see Equation \ref{eq:exp-decomp}), I will now present this decomposition in the excess risk decomposition setup. In Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-diagram} below, the set of all functions is contained in the large rectangle and the constrained set of functions, $\mathcal{F}$, is contained in the smaller circle. As a reminder, the constrained set of functions must be considered, $\mathcal{F}$, to prevent overfitting and reduce the computational burden of finding a model with low generalization error (for a review, see section on [Constrained Empirical Risk Minimization](#constrained-erm)). 

To present bias, variance, and noise within the excess risk decomposition setup, three points must be made. First, Bayes risk (panel A) corresponds to the same error defined by noise (panel B). With both the Bayes risk and noise, the error being defined corresponds to the generalization error of the Bayes decision function (i.e., the difference between the best possible prediction, $f^\ast(\mathbf{x})$, and the actual obtained value, $y$). 

Second, the gap between approximation error (panel A) and bias squared (panel B) decreases as sample size increases (see medium blue text in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-diagram}). As shown in panel A, approximation error represents the difference in generalization error between the Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, and the constrained empirical risk minimizer, $f_\mathcal{F}$ (i.e., the best function in the constrained set of $\mathcal{F}$). As shown in panel B, bias (squared) represents the difference in generalization error between the Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, and the average sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}$. With limited sample size, $\hat{f}$ will always have greater generalization error than $f_\mathcal{F}$. Thus, bias (squared) will always be larger than approximation error with limited sample size. As sample size approaches infinity, however, $\hat{f}$ will become  $f_\mathcal{F}$. Thus, bias (squared) will become equivalent to approximation error with an infinite sample size. 
 
Third, and similar to bias, the gap between the sum of estimation and optimization error (panel A) and variance (panel B) similarly decreases as sample size increases (see medium blue text in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-diagram}). As shown in panel A, estimation error represents the difference in generalization error between the constrained empirical risk minimizer, $f_\mathcal{F}$, and the sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}\_s$. As shown in panel B, variance represents the difference between the average sample risk minimizer, $\bar{f}$, and any given individual sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}\_s$. With limited sample size, $\hat{f}$ will always have greater generalization error than $f_\mathcal{F}$. Thus, variance will always be smaller than estimation error with limited sample size. As sample size approaches infinity, however, $\hat{f}$ will become  $f_\mathcal{F}$. Thus, variance will become equivalent to estimation error with an infinite sample size.

Estimation error represents the difference between the outputs of the sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}_s$, and the constrained empirical risk minimizer,  $f^\mathcal{F}$. Optimization error represents the difference between the optimization risk minimizer, $\tilde{f}_s$, and the sample risk minimizer, $\hat{f}_s$. Panel B: Decomposition of mean squared error. Noise is equivalent to the Bayes risk. Bias squared represents the difference between the outputs of the Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, and the average sample risk minimizer, $\bar{f}$. Variance represents the difference between the  average sample risk minimizer, $\bar{f}$, and the individual sample or optimization risk minimizer, $\hat{f}_s$, $\tilde{f}_s$, respectively. Note that, to the extent that sample size is large, bias (squared) and variance, respectively, become equivalenet to approximation error and the sum of estimation error and optimization error.</span>

# How the 'Players' of Machine Learning Behave: The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Up until this point, I have provided a setup for the game of supervised machine learning and introduced the players of the game. I used the framework of excess risk decomposition to provide a setup for the game of supervised machine learning and decomposed mean squared error loss into bias (squared), variance, and noise, which I introduced as the 'players' of the game. In this section, I will describe how bias, variance, and noise behave. 

To understand the behaviour of bias, variance, and noise, I will explain two points that, together, make up the *bias-variance tradeoff*: The opposing behaviours of bias and variance as model complexity increases (see Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}). For the purpose of this conversation, I will define model complexity as the number of parameters in a model. Thus, a sixth-order polynomial model would be considered more complex than a first-order polynomial model.

First, bias (squared) decreases as model complexity increases. In Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}, the blue line shows the behaviour of bias (squared) as model complexity increases. When an overly simple model such as a first-order polynomial model is used, it will lead to *underfitting*: When a model does not capture important features that predict the outcome. In the wine example, wine quality was set as the outcome of a second-order polynomial model of weather and winemaking quality (along with an interaction term; see Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate}). With a first-order polynomial model, the effect of the second-order predictors and the interaction will not be captured, and so, on average, the model's predictions will err relative to the predictions of the population-generating model (i.e., the Bayes decision function). As model complexity increases, however, the effects of features previously uncaptured by simple models will be modelled. As a result of increasing complexity, predictions will, on average, converge to those of the Bayes decision function. 

Second, and opposite to bias, variance increases as model complexity increases. In Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}, the medium blue line shows the behaviour of variance as model complexity increases. When an overly complex model such as a sixth-order polynomial model is used, the excessive number of parameters will model sample-specific patterns that, in reality, have no effect on the outcome variable. In other words, an overly complex model will overfit the data. In the wine example, wine quality was only set to be the outcome of a second-order polynomial model of weather and winemaking quality (along with an interaction term; see Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate}). With a sixth-order polynomial model, weight values for features raised beyond the second order will be influenced by sample specific patterns. Given that sampling error causes considerable variability in sample-specific patterns, then the predictions of a sixth-order polynomial model on any given sample will, on average, differ considerably from the predictions of the average sixth-order polynomial model. As model complexity decreases, however, fewer parameters will exist, and so sample-specific patterns will be less likely to affect weights and, therefore, variance will decrease.

With bias and variance having opposite relations with model complexity, a tradeoff emerges. That is, an optimization problem emerges whereby variance tends to increase as bias decreases. Returning to the wine example, if the tourist focuses solely on reducing bias, then variance will increase exponentially, causing the generalization error (i.e., dark blue line of mean squared error in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}) to be considerably high. Conversely, if the tourist focuses solely on reducing variance, then bias will increase exponentially and cause generalization error (i.e., dark blue line of mean squared error in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}). Thus, to obtain a model with desirable generalization error, an optimum must be identified whereby bias must be decreased without increasing variance too much. 

One last point must be mentioned with respect to noise. Noise remains constant as model complexity increases. In Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}, the light blue line shows the behaviour of noise as model complexity increases. Noise represents the generalization error of the Bayes decision function; that is, the difference between the population model and the obtained outcome values. Because there is only one Bayes decision function and one population model, they are not affected from the polynomial model used to analyze the data. Thus, noise is constant across model complexity. If noise is too high, it could suggest data cleaning is needed and/or too many errors have been incurred in data collection. 

For the interested reader, I will provide the code for generating in a future [demonstration](https://sebastiansciarra.com/coding_tricks/) post.

# Using the Bias-Variance Tradeoff to Develop Rules of Supervised Machine Learning{#rules-ml}

With an understanding of the behaviour of bias, variance, and noise, it is now possible to deduce rules of supervised machine learning. In Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-rules}, I show two general patterns of empirical loss (light blue line) and generalization error (dark blue line) as a function of sample size. Before explaining each panel in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-rules}, three points need to be mentioned. First, empirical loss is always lower than generalization error because models are effectively always influenced by sample-specific features in the training data (for an example see Figure \ref{fig:constrained-erm}. Second, to represent the common practice of designing models to meet some benchmark level of error, I used the dashed horizontal line in each panel to specify some target amount of generalization error, $\epsilon$. Third, text on each plot describes the solution for each problem.

  <span><em>Note. </em> Text on each panel indicates the solution or rule for each problem. Panel A: The pattern of empirical loss and generalization caused by high bias. Empirical loss and generalization remain above the target error ($\epsilon$) because the model is too simple and cannot model patterns that affect the outcome. Because the model cannot even achieve the target error level ($\epsilon$) on the training data, this is an indication that important patterns are not being modelled. In order to resolve the problem of high bias, the model's complexity must be increased, which can be accomplished by decreasing regularization, boosting, kernelization, and adding features. Panel B: The pattern of empirical loss and generalization caused by high variance. Because only the empirical loss is below the targer error level ($\epsilon$), this is an indication that the model is overfitting sample-specific patterns. Overfitting can be solved by either adding more data and/or decreasing model complexity by, for instance, increasing regularization or boosting.</em></span> 
  </div>
</div>

Beginning with panel A in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-rules}, the pattern of generalization error and empirical loss is caused by high bias (or underfitting). In the case were bias is high, the empirical loss and generalization error are both above the target level of error. Because the model cannot even achieve the target error level, $\epsilon$, on the training data, this is an indication that important patterns are not being modelled. In other words, the model under consideration is underfitting the training data. If a model has high bias, adding more data will not help because the model lacks the parameters to model any additional patterns that may be discovered from the additional data. In order to resolve the problem of high bias, the model's complexity must be increased, which can be accomplished by decreasing regularization, boosting, kernelization, and adding features. 

Ending with panel B in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-rules}, the pattern of generalization error and empirical loss is caused by high variance (or overfitting). In the case were variance is high, the empirical loss is below the target level of error, $\epsilon$, but not the generalization error. Because only the empirical loss is below the targer error level, this is an indication that the model is fitting sample-specific patterns. In other words, the model under consideration is overfitting the training data. To resolve the problem of high variance, two solutions exist. First, more data can be added. By adding more data, the model is exposed to a broader range of patterns, and so may be better able to discern noise from effect, thus reducing the effects of outliers. Second, model complexity can be decreased, which can be accomplished by increasing regularization and boosting.  


For the interested reader, I have provided the Python and R code below (see lines <a href="#860">860--924</a>  and lines <a href="#925">925--999</a>, respectively).

# Boundary Conditions on the Rules of Machine Learning

Although the previous sections showed a tradeoff between bias and variance and showed that rules could be deduced from this tradeoff, these rules are, unfortunately, not universal. In perusing recent papers, I found (at least) two boundary conditions exist on the rules of supervised machine learning presented in Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-rules}. 

First, the bias-variance tradeoff disappears with exceedingly complex functions (for great introductions, see {{< citePara "belkin2019;neal2019;dar2021" >}}). I have reprinted Figure \ref{fig:plot-double-descent} from {{< cite "belkin2019" >}} to show a more accurate depiction of the relation between generalization error and model complexity known as the double descent curve. Before explaining the double descent curve in Figure \ref{fig:plot-double-descent}, three points must be made with respect to terminology. First, and beginning with the x-axis, the capacity of $\mathcal{H}$ can be conceptualized as the complexity of a function $f$ for the purpose of this discussion. Second, *test risk* is synonymous with generalization error and *training risk* is synonymous with empirical loss (whether the loss be on a training, validation, or test set). Third, and last, the *interpolation threshold* represents the point at which the complexity of the function is sufficient enough such that it achieves zero loss on the training data. After the interpolation threshold, functions can be said to be *over-parameterized* and, before the threshold, functions can be said to be *under-parameterized*. Returning to Figure \ref{fig:plot-double-descent}, the test risk curve follows a U-shaped curve as in the traditional bias-variance explanation (or "classical" regime; see Figure \ref{fig:bias-var-plot}), but then decreases exponentially as the capacity of $\mathcal{F}$ (i.e., model complexity) increases past the interpolation threshold. Thus, the bias-variance tradeoff ceases to be a tradeoff after the point which a function has sufficient number of parameters to achieve zero error on training data. Some examples of of the bias-variance tradeoff violations have occurred with neural networks and decision trees (see {{< citePara "belkin2019" >}}).

Belkin et al., 2019, <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, <em>116</em>(32), p. 15850 (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1903070116">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1903070116</a>).</span>

</div>

Second, the rules of supervised machine learning presented in the previous [section](#rules-ml) appear to be dependent on the specific loss functions, as bias-variance tradeoffs and bias-variance-noise decompositions do not always occur with other loss functions. For example, although a bias-variance decomposition occurs with mean absolute error, there appears to be no bias-variance tradeoff with this loss function {{< cite "gao2021" see also >}}.[^6]  With respect to margin loss functions (e.g., logistic, hinge, exponential), a bias-variance decomposition only occurs with strictly convex gradient-symmetric loss functions {{< cite "wood2022" >}}. As one final example, {{< cite "james2003" >}} found 


[^6]: See {{< cite "robeson2023" >}} for a different and arguable more useful decomposition of mean absolute error.

# Conclusion

In this paper, supervised machine learning was conceptualized as a game with the goal of maximizing predictive ability. To understand the game being played in supervised machine learning, I provided a setup, the players, and the rules of the game. Excess risk decomposition was used to provide a setup for the game. The players of bias (squared), variance, and noise were obtained by decomposing the mean squared error loss function. Finally, two rules of supervised machine learning were deduced using the bias variance tradeoff. I then ended the paper with a discussion on boundary conditions for the rules of supervised machine learning.
