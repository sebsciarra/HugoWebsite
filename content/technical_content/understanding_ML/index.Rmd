Two points require mentioning before beginning this demonstration post on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. First, given that this post focuses on providing demonstrations of the EM algorithm, any readers seeking a deeper understanding of this algorithm can consult my technical post on the [EM algorithm](https://sebastiansciarra.com/technical_content/em/). Second, Python and R code are used throughout this post such that objects created in Python are brought into R for plotting. To use Python and R interchangeably, I use the `reticulate` package made for R and create a conda environment to use Python (see lines <a href="#1">1--12</a> below).

```{r python-r-setup, eval=F, echo=T}

# Introduction 
In supervised machine learning, the goal is to predict. Whether the focus is to predict churn rates (among employes and/or customers), regions with high potential for growth, or something as innocuous as fruit fly behaviour, supervised machine learning can be used to solve these problems. Although a near endless number of models can be deployed to predict a given outcome, it is important that data scientists not rely on trial and error to find effective models and, instead, make purposeful decisions. To do so, it important that that data scientists understand the game of machine learning. 

To explain the game of supervised machine learning, I will do so in six parts. First, I will provide a necessary background by presenting a formal model of learning. Second, I will provide a theoretical framework for understanding the game of supervised machine learning. Third, I will introduce the 'players' (i.e., bias, variance, and noise) of supervised machine learning by decomposing squared error. Fourth, I will explain the behaviours of bias, variance, and noise by presenting the bias-variance tradeoff. Fifth, I will explain the rules of supervised machine learning and how to succeed, Sixth, and last, I will provide an overview of situations where the rules of supervised machine learning cannot be applied. 

# A Formal Model of Learning 

To provide the context of supervised machine learning, I begin with a formal model of learning and present it in three parts. First, I will present the learning context. Second, I will present the learning model. Third, and last, I will present the selection of models. 

## Learning Context

In this section, I will present the learning context. Consider an example where a tourist arrives in a new country and wants to learn how to identify a good wine without opening the bottle. Given her experience with wine, she decides to use two features: 1) the weather that occurred for the particular year the wine was produced and 2) the winemaking quality. Both features are ranked on a 1--10 scale (where 1 indicates poor weather/winemaking quality and 10 indicates excellent weather/winemaking quality). To determine the effectiveness of this approach, she decides to taste the wines of several vineyards and, for each wine, rate the quality of the weather during the year, the winemaking quality, and then taste each wine and provide a rating (1--10 scale). After collecting the data, the tourist plans to take a subset of the data to train her models. In more formal terms, there are two components that would be considered as learning inputs: 

1) *Feature space* ($\mathbf{X}$): the set of features used for prediction. In the current example, the features of weather ($\mathbf{x}_1$) and winemaking quality ($\mathbf{x}_2$) for each wine are stored in a matrix, $\mathbf{X} = \[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2\]$, with each row being an observation such that $\mathbf{x} = {x_1, x_2}$. Mathematically, we can represent the feature space as $\mathbf{X} = \[1, 10\]^2$. 
2) *Outcome space* ($\mathbf{Y}$): the set of variables being predicted. Because there is only one outcome variable of the wine quality ratings, the outcome space is simply a vector, $\mathbf{y}_1$. Given that wine quality ratings range from 1 to 10, the outcome space can be represented as $\mathbf{Y} = \[1, 10\]$. 

Together, the feature and outcome spaces comprise the data collected by the tourist such that, for each $m$ wine, there is a feature vector/outcome pair, $\mathbf{x}_m, y_m$.

Importantly, the tourist does not and never assumes *realizability*: That the features of weather and winemaking quality completely predict wine quality ratings. Instead, she assumes that, for a given pair of weather and winemaking quality values, there is a distribution of plausible wine ratings, which introduces stochasticity (randomness). Dropping the realizability assumption in the current example is certainly intuitive. Wine quality is affected by many factors outside of weather and winemaking quality such as soil quality, altitude, and age of the vines. Importantly, even if the tourist were to collect data for all the variables that affect wine quality, realizability (i.e., a one-to-one mapping between the predictors and and the outcome) would not occur because of the aforementioned stochasticity (randomness) and measurement error.[^1]

[^1]: Although measurement error is unlikely with directly observable variables (or manifest variables) such as altitude, measurement error is likely be incurred when measuring a variable such as winemaking quality because it is not directly observable; it is a latent variable that must be approximated using indicators (e.g., cleanliness of winemaking procedure, treatment of grapes, winemaker's motives, etc.). 

To reflect the uncertainty that follows from dropping realizability (also known as *agnostic learning*), the tourist assumes a joint distribution over the feature and outcome spaces. In contrast to the realizability setting where there is a one-to-one mapping function between the feature and outcome spaces, $f: \mathbf{X} \rightarrow \mathbf{Y}$, a probabilistic relation between the feature and outcome spaces is specified. Specifically, I assume a joint distribution over the feature and outcome spaces, $\mathcal{D}(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$, such that a distribution of possible outcomes exists for any given set of feature values, $\mathcal{D}((x, y)|x)$. By conceptualizing the feature-outcome space as probabilistic, the tourist can account for measurement error and stochasticity. 


## Learning Model 

With a setup for the learning context, I will present a learning model. Revisiting the wine assessment example, the tourist has now returned from the vineyards and recorded information on each $n$ wine regarding the weather ($x_1$), winemaking quality ($x_2$), and quality of the wine ($y$). The tourist then takes a large subset of the data for training models and uses weather and winemaking quality to predict wine quality. To evaluate her models, she decides to use the mean squared error loss such that 

$$
\begin{align} 
MSE &= \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}\big(f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i\big)^2}{n} = \frac{\sum^n\_{i=1} \ell \ \big(f(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i\big)^2}{n}
\label{eq:mean-sq-error}
\end{align} 
$$

where $n$ is the number of observations/sample size in the data set and $i$ is an individual observation. Under ideal circumstances, the tourist would know the joint distribution underlying the feature and outcome spaces, $D(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the *generalization/true error* or *risk* of a function: The error on unseen data. Obtaining the generalization error is important because it indicates how well a model will perform when deployed. If the tourist knows the joint distribution, then the generalization error can be computed as the expected squared loss such that 

$$
\begin{align} 
L_{\mathcal{D}}(f) = \mathbb{E}\[\ell \ \big(f(\mathbf{x}), y\big)^2\],
\end{align} 
$$

where $L_D(f)$ is the loss of $f$ with respect to the joint distribution, $\mathcal{D}$. Unfortunately, because the joint distribution is seldom known in practice, generalization error cannot be directly computed. 

Although generalization is not directly computable, one solution is to compute loss on a collected. By using a sample of collected data, the strong law of large numbers indicates that, as the number of observations approaches infinity, the loss obtained on the sample data will approach the generalization error (see Equation \ref{eq:gen-error-approx}):

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^n (f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i)^2}{n} &= L\_{\mathcal{D}}(f). 
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, to obtain an approximation of the generalization error, loss can be computed on a sample, which is often called the *empirical loss* and represented as 

$$
\begin{align} 
L_S(f) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\big(f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i\big)^2}{n}.
\label{eq:training-loss}
\end{align} 
$$

It should be noted that a minimum sample size is required for the empirical loss to estimate the generalization error within some margin of error. This minimum sample size depends on several factors such as the complexity of the class of functions being used (or hypothesis class), obtaining a bad sample that leads to a generalization error above a certain amount, and the probability of obtaining a bad sample (for detailed explanations, see [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5NlRg8SjZg&list=PLPW2keNyw-usgvmR7FTQ3ZRjfLs5jT4BO) on the theory of machine learning).  

## Model Selection

Because the empirical loss provides an approximation of the general loss, one strategy for finding the function with the lowest generalization error, $f^\ast$, is to find the function with the lowest empirical loss. This approach of finding the function with the lowest empirical loss is often called *empirical risk minimization*. Mathematically, empirical risk minimization can be represented as 

$$
\begin{align}
f^\ast &= \underset{f}{\arg\min} \ Ls(f), 
\label{eq:erm}
\end{align}
$$

where $f^\ast$ is function in the set of all possible functions, $f$, that obtains the lowest empirical loss. 

Two points deserve mention with respect to $f^\ast$. First, it is often called the *empirical risk minimizer* because it obtains the lowest empirical loss. Second, in the current example, because empirical risk minimization occurs over the set of all possible functions, $f^*$, then the best possible function will inevitably exist in this set. The best possible function (i.e., the function with the lowest generalization error) is often called the *Bayes decision function*. Because we assume agnostic learning (i.e., that no function can perfectly predict the outcome), the Bayes decision function will have nonzero loss, which is often called the *Bayes risk*.


# Theory for Understanding the 'Game' of Machine Learning

In the sections that follow, I will provide a theoretical framework for understanding how three types of error inevitably emerge in the formal model of learning presented above. Importantly, these three types of error can be conceptualized as components of generalization error. For each type of error, I will provide Python code that simulates it. 

In order to simulate type of error with Python code, a data set is first required. Therefore, before explaining each type of error I will first provide a brief overview for the data generation procedure in the wine assessment example. 

## Preamble: Data Generation Procedure

In the wine assessment example, there two features and one outcome. For the features, the tourist collected data on weather and winemaking quality and computed composite scores for each feature on a 1--10 scale. For the outcome, the tourist tasted each wine and similarly calculated composite scores for wine quality on a 1--10 scale (1 indicates a poor wine and 10 indicates an excellent wine). To simulate these data, I will assume agnostic learning and, therefore, use a joint distribution over the feature and outcome spaces, with the features of weather ($\mathbf{x}_1$) and winemaking quality ($\mathbf{x}_2$) being normally distributed such that

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{X} &= \[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2\] \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma) \cdot \mathbb{I}(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2 \in \[1, 10\]), \\\\
\mu &= \[5, 7\] \text{ and} \\\\
\sigma &= \[1.2, 1.4\] \\\\
\end{align*}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

with the covariance matrix

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align*}
\rho_{x_1, x_2} &= .35  \text{ and} \\\\
\Sigma &= \begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma^2_1  & \rho_{x_1, x_2}\sigma_1\sigma_2 \\\\
\rho_{x_1, x_2}\sigma_1\sigma_2 & \sigma^2_2
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Note that a truncated normal distribution was used to generate data for the features such that all the values for each feature fell between 1 and 10 (inclusive). To generate the outcome values for wine quality, I used the regression equation shown below in Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate}:

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{Xw} + \mathbf{e}, \text { where}
\label{eq:outcome-generate} \\\\
\mathbf{X} &= \[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{x}_1^2, \mathbf{x}_2^2, \mathbf{x}_1\mathbf{x}_2\], \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{w} &= \[0.3 ,  0.1 ,  0.07, -0.1 ,  0.1\], \text{ and} \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{e} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1.5). \nonumber 
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Because Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate} produced outcome values that were not scaled within a 1--10 range, I used min-max normalization formula shown below in Equation \ref{eq:rescale} to scale the outcome values of wine quality within a 1--10 range such that 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y}_{scaled} = a + \frac{(\mathbf{y} - \min(\mathbf{y}))(b-a)}{\max(\mathbf{y})-\min(\mathbf{y})}
\label{eq:rescale},
\end{align}
$$

where $a$ indicates the new lower limit (i.e., 1), $b$ indicates the new upper limit (i.e., 10), $\min(y)$ indicates the old lower limit, and $\max(y)$ indicates the old upper limit. To compute the old lower limit, I used the lowest possible value for $\mathbf{x}_1$ and the highest possible value for $\mathbf{x}_2$ of 10, which, in turn, set the values for the polynomial features ($\mathbf{x}^2_1, \mathbf{x}^2_2$) and interaction feature ($\mathbf{x}_1\mathbf{x}_2$). I then subtracted an error value that corresponded to three standard deviations below the mean, yielding the following computation for the old lower limit in Equation \ref{eq:old-lower-limit}:

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\text{Old lower limit } &= \mathbf{w}^\top \[1, 10, 1, 100, 10] - 3(1.5) 
\label{eq:old-lower-limit} \\\\
&=-12.13. \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

To compute the old upper limit, I used the highest possible values for $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ of 10, which, in turn, set the values for the polynomial features ($\mathbf{x}^2_1, \mathbf{x}^2_2$) and interaction feature ($\mathbf{x}_1\mathbf{x}_2$). I then added an error value that corresponded to three standard deviations above the mean, yielding the following computation for the old upper limit in Equation \ref{eq:old-upper-limit}:

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\text{Old lower limit } &= \mathbf{w}^\top \[10, 10, 10, 100, 100] + 3(1.5) 
\label{eq:old-upper-limit} \\\\
&=15.50. \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

With the outcome variable of wine quality being scaled, the population regression coefficients can also be scaled by first computing a scaling factor (Equation \ref{eq:scaling}) and then multiplying the old regression weights by the scaling factor (Equation \ref{eq:scaled-weights}).

$$
\begin{spreadlines}{0.5em}
\begin{align}
\text{Scaling factor} &= \frac{\text{New scale range}}{\text{Old scale range}} 
\label{eq:scaling} \\\\
&= \frac{10 - 1}{15.50 - (-12.13)}  \nonumber \\\\
&=  0.33 \nonumber \\\\
\mathbf{w}_{scaled} &= \mathbf{w}(0.33)  
\label{eq:scaled-weights} \\\\
&= [0.10, 0.03, 0.02, -0.03,  0.03] \tag{eq:scaled-values}
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}
$$

Lastly, the new scaled intercept value can be computed by first computing the mean of each feature in $\bar{\mathbf{X}}$, taking the weighted sum of the rescaled weights and mean of each feature, $ \mathbf{w}_{scaled}^\top\bar{\mathbf{X}}$, and then subtracting this value from the mean outcome value, $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$ (see Equation \ref{eq:scaled-intercept}). 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{intercept}_{ scaled} &= \bar{\mathbf{y}} - \mathbf{w}^\top\_{scaled} \bar{\mathbf{X}}
\label{eq:scaled-intercept}
\end{align}
$$

To generate the feature data, I first copied the `trun_mvnt` module from GitHub and installed it in my current project directory using the below Bash code. 

```{bash, engine = 'bash',  eval=F, hlopts=list( language = 'bash')}
git clone https://github.com/ralphma1203/trun_mvnt.git
```

The Python code block below (lines <a href="#2">2--108</a>) defines the functions that generate the data for the wine example such that there are two features (`weather`, `winemaking_quality`) and one outcome variable (`wine_quality`). The outcome variable is created using Equation \ref{eq:outcome-generate} and then scaled using Equation \ref{eq:rescale}. 

```{python data-generation-functions, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}

```

The Python code block below (lines <a href="#109">109--118</a>) generates the multivariate normal normal such that all values for the features and outcome variables are truncated between values of 1 and 10. Importantly, because we are generating the data, we can adopt an omniscient approach in the winemaking example and generate one data for computing empirical loss and another data set for computing generalization error. Note that the sample size used for the generalization error is substantially larger so that generalization error can be accurately estimated.

```{python data-generation, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}

## Approximation Error: The Result of Having to Constrain Empirical Loss Minimization 

To obtain an approximation of a function's ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data (i.e., generalization), the strong law of large numbers indicated that, with sufficient sample size, the performance on sample data would be sufficient. As a corollary, empirical risk minimization then suggested that the best possible function could be identified by determining the function that obtained the lowest empirical loss. Unfortunately, empirical risk minimization inevitably fails when optimizing over over all possible functions. 


### Overfitting: The Failure of Empirical Risk Minimization 

To recall, empirical risk minimization assumes that the function with the lowest generalization error can be identified by simply determining the function with the lowest empirical loss. Mathematically, 

$$
\begin{align}
f^* &=\underset{f}{\arg\min} \ Ls(f).
\tag{\ref{eq:erm} $\$ revisited}
\end{align}
$$

Although optimizing empirical loss over all possible functions makes theoretical sense, it is impractical for two reasons. First, doing so is computationally demanding. Second, and perhaps most important, optimizing generalization error over all possible functions will likely result in *overfitting*: When the generalization error of a function is considerably higher than its empirical loss because the function's high complexity has caused it to (over)fit sample-specific information.  

Overfitting commonly occurs as an outcome of minimizing empirical loss over a set of functions that is too complex or large. As an example of overfitting, I compute empirical loss and generalization error over the set of polynomial models up to the ninth order ($P = 9$) such that 

$$
\begin{align}
f \in \mathcal{O}:f(\mathbf{x}_i) &= \text{int} + \bigg(\sum\_{p=1}^{P} w\_{p_1} x^p\_{1_i} + w\_{p_2} x^p\_{2_i}\bigg) + \mathbb{I}\_{(P\ge 2)}\bigg(\sum\_{p=1}^{P-1}\sum\_{q=1}^{P-1} w\_{pq} x^p\_{1_i} x^q\_{2_i}\bigg),
\label{eq:all-functions}
\end{align}
$$

where $f(\mathbf{x}\_i)$ represents the predicted wine quality value for $i^{th}$ wine, which is the sum of an intercept ($\text{int}$), the weighted sum of the corresponding $i^{th}$ weather ($x_{1_i}$) and winemaking quality ($x_{2_i}$), and the weighted sum of all possible two-way corresponding interactions. Note that, in Equation \ref{eq:all-functions}, interactions are only computed if the specified polynomial order is greater than or equal to 2, $\mathbb{I}_({P \ge 2)}$. The Python code block below contains functions that compute the generalization error and empirical loss (using mean squared error; see Equation \ref{eq:mean-sq-error}) for each polynomial model with an order in the specified range.

  #concatenate poly_orders and dataframe to create complete dataframe
  df_emp_gen_errors = pd.concat([poly_orders, df_emp_gen_errors], axis = 1)
  
  return df_emp_gen_errors
```

If empirical risk minimization is followed, then the function with the highest polynomial order would be chosen as the function with the lowest generalization error. Figure \ref{fig:emp-loss} shows that empirical loss decreases almost linearly as polynomial order increases. The Python code block below computes and plots empirical loss for each polynomial model up to the ninth order.

If generalization error is examined, however, then the conclusion of empirical risk minimization to use the highest-order polynomial model results in a highly undesirable outcome. Figure \ref{fig:overfit-plot} shows that, while empirical loss decreases as model's polynomial order increases, generalization error suddenly increases exponentially after the seventh polynomial order. Specifically, while empirical loss remains below 1 across all polynomial orders, the generalization error goes from a value of approximately 7.11 at the seventh polynomial order to a value of approximately 823.25 at the ninth polynomial order. Thus, although the most complex polynomial model results in the lowest empirical loss, it results in the highest generalization error, and so would perform the worst if used to make predictions on new data. The Python code block below computes and plots the empirical loss and generalization error for each polynomial model up to the ninth order.

Given that the previous example showed how overfitting occurred with just a subset of complex functions, it then becomes apparent that overfitting is inevitable if all functions. Overfitting presents a serious issue to practitioners because it can lead to the use of models that make highly inaccurate predictions and cause organizations to incur severe costs. Fortunately, the occurence overfitting can be reduced by modifying the method of empirical risk minimization.


### Reducing the Chance of Overfitting: Constrained Empirical Risk Minimization

Although overfitting is inevitable when all possible functions are considered, it is conceivable that a function with low generalization error can still be found if only a subset of functions are considered. By restricting the set of function over which to optimize empirical loss, it may be possible to largely prevent overfitting. This approach of restricting the set of functions over which to optimize empirical loss is known as  *constrained empirical risk minimization* and can be represented mathematically as

$$
\begin{align}
f_\mathcal{F} =  \underset{\mathcal{f \in F}}{\arg \min} \ L_s(f), 
\end{align}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ represents the constrained set of functions.

Returning to the wine example, the tourist may have knowledge that allows her to constrain the set of function over which to optimize empirical loss. Specifically, she will only consider polynomial functions up to the fifth order and omit the two-way interaction terms because of how introduce complexity in an exponential way with respect polynomial order; that is, they grow exponentially in number as a function of polynomial order. Thus, the restricted set of functions over which the tourist will optimize empirical loss is 


$$
\begin{align}
f \in \mathcal{F}:f(\mathbf{x}_i) &= \text{int} + \bigg(\sum\_{p=1}^{P} w\_{p_1} x^p\_{1_i} + w\_{p_2} x^p\_{2_i}\bigg),
\label{eq:constrained-functions}
\end{align}
$$

where $P = 5$. Figure \ref{fig:constrained-erm} below shows the empirical loss and generalization error as a function of polynomial order with constrained empirical risk minimization (see Python clode block below for corresponding code). Across all polynomial orders, empirical loss provides a close approximation of generalization error. Thus, the tourist has prevented the occurrence of overfitting by implementing constrained risk minimization. As an aside, a proof of the learning success of constrained empirical risk minimization can be found in [Section 2.3.1](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf#page=94) of Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (2004).

In using constrained empirical risk minimization, the tourist can select the empirical risk minimizer and accurate predict wine quality for unseen data. With constrained empirical risk minimization optimization, an upper limit is placed on the complexity of functions, and, to the extent that complexity is limited, the incidence of overfitting will be reduced. As an aside, other methods such as regularized regression (for a review, see) and bagging (see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205)) can be used to combat overfitting. Although constrained empirical risk minimization appears is a solution, it is by no means a perfect solution, as will be discussed in the next section.


#### Model Selection in Practice: Train, Validate, and Test

Before proceeding to discuss the limitations of constrained empirical risk minimization, a discussion regarding model selection in practice is apropos. Up to this point, I used two data sets to compute empirical loss and generalization error, with the data set for generalization error being considerably large in order to obtain an accurate estimate. Given that I generated the data with Python functions, I could easily use two different data sets for computing empirical loss and generalization error. Unfortunately, the privilege of generating data with functions does exist in practice: Data must be collected and are, therefore, finite. 

Although data are finite in practice, practitioners still want to accomplish three goals of developing models, comparing them, and then estimating how well the best model performs on unseen data (i.e., generalization error). Importantly, practitioners want to accomplish each goal and prevent overfitting. To do so, they split the data into three parts to accomplish each goal:

1) *Training set*: data used to develop models and obtain parameter estimates. 
2) *Validation set*: data used to obtain estimate of each model's generalization error so that models can be compared. Because validation data is new (with respect to the training data), overfitting is unlikely, and so the model that obtains the lowest validation error is assumed to be the best model. 
3) *Test set*: data serves as a last check that the best model identified using the validation set is indeed the best model. Because many models may be compared using the validation set, it is conceivable that one model may outperform all the other ones by overfitting on patterns/noise specific to the validation set. To ensure this is not the case, empirical loss is computed on the test set. 

Three points deserve mention with respect to model selection in practice. First, more refined approaches exist for model selection such as cross validation (see [Section 7.10](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf#page=260) in Haste et al. (2017)) and [bagging](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205). Second, the way in which data are trained, validated, and tested should resemble how the model will be used after deployment. For example, if a model will be used to make predictions one month into the future, it should be trained, validated, and tested such that training data do not include data points within one month of when predictions will be made. Third, deciding each sets sample size is an important decision, and a good dicussion on this issue can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13610074/is-there-a-rule-of-thumb-for-how-to-divide-a-dataset-into-training-and-validatio). 

### The Irreducible Error That Results From Constrained Empirical Risk Minimization: Approximation Error

Although constrained empirical risk minimization reduces the incidence of overfitting, it is not without its limitations. By constraining the set of functions over which to optimize empirical loss, it is unlikely that the best possible function (i.e., Bayes decision function) will exist in the constrained set. Figure \ref{fig:approx-error} depicts the set of all functions and the constrained set of functions, $\mathcal{F}$. Although the Bayes decision function, $f^\ast$, exists in the set of all functions, it does not exist in the constrained set of functions. Thus, the best function in the constrained set of functions will have a generalization error greater than that of the Bayes decision function, with the difference between the two functions constituting *approximation error* (see Equation \ref{eq:approx-error} below). 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Approximation error} \hspace{0.25cm} &=  L_D(f_{\mathcal{F}}) - L_D(f^\ast) 
\label{eq:approx-error}
\end{align}
$$

  </div>
</div>

Returning to the wine example with the tourist, approximation error can be obtained by calculating the difference between the Bayes decision function and the constrained empirical risk minimizer. Beginning with the Bayes decision function, the scaled population regression weights from Equation \ref{eq:scaled-values} can be used to compute predictions. The difference between the predictions and actual wine quality values are used to compute the Bayes risk (or generalization error of the Bayes decision function). Ending with the constrained empirical risk minimizer, Figure \ref{fig:constrained-erm} indicated that the polynomial function with order of two resulted in the lowest generalization error. The Python code block below constructs a function for computing the Bayes risk. 


```{python bayes-decision, eval=T, echo=T,  class_name = 'python-code', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
def compute_bayes_risk(data):

The Python code block below computes the approximation error by calculating the difference between the Bayes risk and the generalization error of the constrained empirical risk minimizer. Note that I generated another large data set to get a close approximation of the best possible function in the constrained set (i.e., get the best possible parameter estimates for the second-order polynomial model with no interactions).

```{python approximation-error, echo=T, eval=T,  class_name = 'python-code', results = 'hold', hlopts=list(language = 'python')}
best_in_class_sample_size = 1e4

#use large data set to obtain a close approximation of the best possible estimates for the second-order 
#polynomial model (without interactions)
data_best_in_class = generate_mult_trunc_normal(cov_matrix = cov_matrix, mu = mu, sd = sd, 
                                             rho = rho_weather_winemaking, sample_size = best_in_class_sample_size, seed=7)
                                             
#Bayes risk 
bayes_risk = compute_bayes_risk(data = data_gen_error)

#compute empirical loss and generalization error for polynomial models up to fifth order
constrained_erm = compute_all_emp_gen_errors(data_emp_loss = data_best_in_class, 
                                             data_gen_error = data_gen_error,
                                             include_interactions = False, 
                                             poly_order_range=range(2, 3))
                                             
#compute approximation error
approx_error = constrained_erm["gen_error"][0] - bayes_risk

print('Approximation error:', np.round(a = approx_error, decimals = 5))

## Estimation Error: The Result of Having Limited Amount of Data

In constraining empirical risk minimization, the empirical risk minimizer is only guaranteed to be found to the extent that sample size is large. Given that large sample sizes cannot always be obtained in practice, then empirical risk minimizer, $f_\mathcal{F}$, is unlikely to result. Instead, analysis of the obtained sample will result in some imperfect estimation of $f_\mathcal{F}$, which I will call the *sample risk minimizer* and denote as $\hat{f}_n$. As shown below in Equation \ref{eq:estim-error}, estimation error can be obtained by computing the difference in generalization error between the constrained empirical risk minimizer and the sample risk minimizer. 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Estimation error}  \hspace{0.25cm} &=  L_D(\hat{f}_n) - L_D(f\_{\mathcal{F}}) 
\label{eq:estim-error}
\end{align}
$$

Returning to the wine example, estimation error can be computed as a function of sample size. Figure \ref{fig:est-error} below
