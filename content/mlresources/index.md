This is a list of useful resources I have stumbled upon while completing my dissertation and learning about machine learning, statistics, and programming. 


## Courses and Lecture Series'

* [CS 47980 - Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems](https://www.youtube.com/@kilianweinberger698/playlists)
* [Bloomberg - Foundations of Machine Learning](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#about)
* [Computer Science 25300 / 35300 & Statistics 27700 - Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/teaching/mathematical-foundations-of-machine-learning-fall-2021/)
* [CS 156 - Learning Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A)
* [CS 485/685 - Machine Learning Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5NlRg8SjZg&list=PLPW2keNyw-usgvmR7FTQ3ZRjfLs5jT4BO): this is a more advanced course that I personally would only encourage taking after taking at least two of the above courses. 


## Textbooks

* [Python Packages](https://py-pkgs.org/welcome): excellent book for writing Python packages. 
* [Matrix Algebra Useful for Statistics](https://books.google.ca/books?id=zR-ZDgAAQBAJ&dq=matrix+algebra+useful+for+statistics&lr=): great resource for learning linear algebra.
* [Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages](https://www.amazon.ca/Introducing-Python-Modern-Computing-Packages/dp/1492051365): useful for gaining basic knowledge of Python.
* [Learning SQL Generate, Manipulate, and Retrieve Data](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-sql-3rd/9781492057604/): great resource for gaining SQL knowledge. 
* [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org): great resource for leaning how to make packages in R. 
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz): useful for gaining a deeper understanding of R 
* [R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf): interesting book that delves into the counterintuitive behaviour of R. 
* [Learning Apache Drill](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-apache-drill/9781492032786/)
* [Parallel R](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/parallel-r/9781449317850/): useful for setting up parallel computign in R (especially for computationally demanding simulations). 
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf): advanced textbook for machine learning.
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://info.usherbrooke.ca/pmjodoin/cours/ift603/BishopBook.pdf): advanced textbook for machine learning.
